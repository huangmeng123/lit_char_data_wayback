{'author': 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
 'book_title': 'The Great Gatsby',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Great Gatsby is a story told by Nick Carraway, who was '
                 "once Gatsby's neighbor, and he tells the story sometime "
                 'after 1922, when the incidents that fill the book take '
                 'place. As the story opens, Nick has just moved from the '
                 'Midwest to West Egg, Long Island, seeking his fortune as a '
                 'bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick travels '
                 'across the Sound to the more fashionable East Egg to visit '
                 'his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband, Tom, a hulking, '
                 'imposing man whom Nick had known in college. There he meets '
                 'professional golfer Jordan Baker. The Buchanans and Jordan '
                 'Baker live privileged lives, contrasting sharply in '
                 "sensibility and luxury with Nick's more modest and grounded "
                 'lifestyle. When Nick returns home that evening, he notices '
                 'his neighbor, Gatsby, mysteriously standing in the dark and '
                 'stretching his arms toward the water, and a solitary green '
                 'light across the Sound. One day, Nick is invited to '
                 'accompany Tom, a blatant adulterer, to meet his mistress, '
                 'Myrtle Wilson, a middle-class woman whose husband runs a '
                 'modest garage and gas station in the valley of ashes, a '
                 'desolate and run-down section of town that marks the '
                 'convergence of the city and the suburbs. After the group '
                 'meets and journeys into the city, Myrtle phones friends to '
                 'come over and they all spend the afternoon drinking at '
                 "Myrtle and Tom's apartment. The afternoon is filled with "
                 'drunken behavior and ends ominously with Myrtle and Tom '
                 'fighting over Daisy, his wife. Drunkenness turns to rage and '
                 "Tom, in one deft movement, breaks Myrtle's nose. Following "
                 'the description of this incident, Nick turns his attention '
                 'to his mysterious neighbor, who hosts weekly parties for the '
                 "rich and fashionable. Upon Gatsby's invitation (which is "
                 "noteworthy because rarely is anyone ever invited to Gatsby's "
                 'parties — they just show up, knowing they will not be turned '
                 'away), Nick attends one of the extravagant gatherings. '
                 'There, he bumps into Jordan Baker, as well as Gatsby '
                 'himself. Gatsby, it turns out, is a gracious host, but yet '
                 'remains apart from his guest — an observer more than a '
                 'participant — as if he is seeking something. As the party '
                 'winds down, Gatsby takes Jordan aside to speak privately. '
                 "Although the reader isn't specifically told what they "
                 "discuss, Jordan is greatly amazed by what she's learned. As "
                 'the summer unfolds, Gatsby and Nick become friends and '
                 'Jordan and Nick begin to see each other on a regular basis, '
                 "despite Nick's conviction that she is notoriously dishonest "
                 '(which offends his sensibilities because he is "one of the '
                 'few honest people" he has ever met). Nick and Gatsby journey '
                 'into the city one day and there Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, '
                 "one of Gatsby's associates and Gatsby's link to organized "
                 'crime. On that same day, while having tea with Jordan Baker, '
                 'Nick learns the amazing story that Gatsby told her the night '
                 'of his party. Gatsby, it appears, is in love with Daisy '
                 'Buchanan. They met years earlier when he was in the army but '
                 'could not be together because he did not yet have the means '
                 'to support her. In the intervening years, Gatsby made his '
                 'fortune, all with the goal of winning Daisy back. He bought '
                 'his house so that he would be across the Sound from her and '
                 'hosted the elaborate parties in the hopes that she would '
                 'notice. It has come time for Gatsby to meet Daisy again, '
                 'face-to-face, and so, through the intermediary of Jordan '
                 'Baker, Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to his little house '
                 'where Gatsby will show up unannounced. The day of the '
                 "meeting arrives. Nick's house is perfectly prepared, due "
                 'largely to the generosity of the hopeless romantic Gatsby, '
                 'who wants every detail to be perfect for his reunion with '
                 'his lost love. When the former lovers meet, their reunion is '
                 'slightly nervous, but shortly, the two are once again '
                 'comfortable with each other, leaving Nick to feel an '
                 'outsider in the warmth the two people radiate. As the '
                 "afternoon progresses, the three move the party from Nick's "
                 "house to Gatsby's, where he takes special delight in showing "
                 'Daisy his meticulously decorated house and his impressive '
                 'array of belongings, as if demonstrating in a very tangible '
                 'way just how far out of poverty he has traveled. At this '
                 'point, Nick again lapses into memory, relating the story of '
                 'Jay Gatsby. Born James Gatz to "shiftless and unsuccessful '
                 'farm people," Gatsby changed his name at seventeen, about '
                 "the same time he met Dan Cody. Cody would become Gatsby's "
                 'mentor, taking him on in "a vague personal capacity" for '
                 'five years as he went three times around the Continent. By '
                 "the time of Cody's death, Gatsby had grown into manhood and "
                 'had defined the man he would become. Never again would he '
                 'acknowledge his meager past; from that point on, armed with '
                 'a fabricated family history, he was Jay Gatsby, '
                 'entrepreneur. Moving back to the present, we discover that '
                 "Daisy and Tom will attend one of Gatsby's parties. Tom, of "
                 'course, spends his time chasing women, while Daisy and '
                 "Gatsby sneak over to Nick's yard for a moment's privacy "
                 'while Nick, accomplice in the affair, keeps guard. After the '
                 'Buchanans leave, Gatsby tells Nick of his secret desire: to '
                 'recapture the past. Gatsby, the idealistic dreamer, firmly '
                 'believes the past can be recaptured in its entirety. Gatsby '
                 'then goes on to tell what it is about his past with Daisy '
                 'that has made such an impact on him. As the summer unfolds, '
                 "Gatsby and Daisy's affair begins to grow and they see each "
                 'other regularly. On one fateful day, the hottest and most '
                 'unbearable of the summer, Gatsby and Nick journey to East '
                 'Egg to have lunch with the Buchanans and Jordan Baker. '
                 'Oppressed by the heat, Daisy suggests they take solace in a '
                 'trip to the city. No longer hiding her love for Gatsby, '
                 'Daisy pays him special attention and Tom deftly picks up on '
                 "what's going on. As the party prepares to leave for the "
                 'city, Tom fetches a bottle of whiskey. Tom, Nick, and Jordan '
                 "drive in Gatsby's car, while Gatsby and Daisy drive Tom's "
                 "coupe. Low on gas, Tom stops Gatsby's car at Wilson's gas "
                 'station, where he sees that Wilson is not well. Like Tom, '
                 "who has just learned of Daisy's affair, Wilson has just "
                 "learned of Myrtle's secret life — although he does not know "
                 'who the man is — and it has made him physically sick. Wilson '
                 "announces his plans to take Myrtle out West, much to Tom's "
                 'dismay. Tom has lost a wife and a mistress all in a matter '
                 'of an hour. Absorbed in his own fears, Tom hastily drives '
                 'into the city. The group ends up at the Plaza hotel, where '
                 'they continue drinking, moving the day closer and closer to '
                 'its tragic end. Tom, always a hot-head, begins to badger '
                 'Gatsby, questioning him as to his intentions with Daisy. '
                 'Decidedly tactless and confrontational, Tom keeps harping on '
                 'Gatsby until the truth comes out: Gatsby wants Daisy to '
                 "admit she's never loved Tom but that, instead, she has "
                 'always loved him. When Daisy is unable to do this, Gatsby '
                 'declares that Daisy is going to leave Tom. Tom, though, '
                 'understands Daisy far better than Gatsby does and knows she '
                 "won't leave him: His wealth and power, matured through "
                 "generations of privilege, will triumph over Gatsby's newly "
                 'found wealth. In a gesture of authority, Tom orders Daisy '
                 "and Gatsby to head home in Gatsby's car. Tom, Nick, and "
                 "Jordan follow. As Tom's car nears Wilson's garage, they can "
                 'all see that some sort of accident has occurred. Pulling '
                 "over to investigate, they learn that Myrtle Wilson, Tom's "
                 'mistress, has been hit and killed by a passing car that '
                 "never bothered to stop, and it appears to have been Gatsby's "
                 'car. Tom, Jordan, and Nick continue home to East Egg. Nick, '
                 'now disgusted by the morality and behavior of the people '
                 'with whom he has been on friendly terms, meets Gatsby '
                 "outside of the Buchanans' house where he is keeping watch "
                 'for Daisy. With a few well-chosen questions, Nick learns '
                 'that Daisy, not Gatsby, was driving the car, although Gatsby '
                 'confesses he will take all the blame. Nick, greatly agitated '
                 'by all that he has experienced during the day, continues '
                 'home, but an overarching feeling of dread haunts him. '
                 "Nearing dawn the next morning, Nick goes to Gatsby's house. "
                 'While the two men turn the house upside down looking for '
                 'cigarettes, Gatsby tells Nick more about how he became the '
                 'man he is and how Daisy figured into his life. Later that '
                 'morning, while at work, Nick is unable to concentrate. He '
                 'receives a phone call from Jordan Baker, but is quick to end '
                 'the discussion — and thereby the friendship. He plans to '
                 'take an early train home and check on Gatsby. The action '
                 "then switches back to Wilson who, distraught over his wife's "
                 'death, sneaks out and goes looking for the driver who killed '
                 "Myrtle. Nick retraces Wilson's journey, which placed him, by "
                 "early afternoon, at Gatsby's house. Wilson murders Gatsby "
                 "and then turns the gun on himself. After Gatsby's death, "
                 'Nick is left to help make arrangements for his burial. What '
                 'is most perplexing, though, is that no one seems overly '
                 "concerned with Gatsby's death. Daisy and Tom mysteriously "
                 'leave on a trip and all the people who so eagerly attended '
                 'his parties, drinking his liquor and eating his food, refuse '
                 "to become involved. Even Meyer Wolfshiem, Gatsby's business "
                 "partner, refuses to publicly mourn his friend's death. A "
                 "telegram from Henry C. Gatz, Gatsby's father, indicates he "
                 "will be coming from Minnesota to bury his son. Gatsby's "
                 'funeral boasts only Nick, Henry Gatz, a few servants, the '
                 'postman, and the minister at the graveside. Despite all his '
                 'popularity during his lifetime, in his death, Gatsby is '
                 'completely forgotten. Nick, completely disillusioned with '
                 'what he has experienced in the East, prepares to head back '
                 'to the Midwest. Before leaving, he sees Tom Buchanan one '
                 'last time. When Tom notices him and questions him as to why '
                 'he didn\'t want to shake hands, Nick curtly offers "You know '
                 'what I think of you." Their discussion reveals that Tom was '
                 "the impetus behind Gatsby's death. When Wilson came to his "
                 'house, he told Wilson that Gatsby owned the car that killed '
                 "Myrtle. In Tom's mind, he had helped justice along. Nick, "
                 'disgusted by the carelessness and cruel nature of Tom, '
                 'Daisy, and those like them, leaves Tom, proud of his own '
                 'integrity. On the last night before leaving, Nick goes to '
                 "Gatsby's mansion, then to the shore where Gatsby once stood, "
                 'arms outstretched toward the green light. The novel ends '
                 'prophetically, with Nick noting how we are all a little like '
                 'Gatsby, boats moving up a river, going forward but '
                 'continually feeling the pull of the past.',

                 'Irwine, hoping that confession will cure his passion. But '
                 'when he speaks to the clergyman at Broxton parsonage the '
                 'following morning, he loses his nerve and says nothing about '
                 'Hetty. Meanwhile, Dinah has encouraged Hetty to come to her '
                 'if she ever needs help, but Hetty, a thoughtless little '
                 'thing who feels that no trouble will ever come to her, '
                 'repulses the offer. Dinah leaves for her home in Snowfield, '
                 'Stonyshire, the next day. Thias Bede is buried, and Adam '
                 'reflects that now he can begin to look forward to marriage; '
                 'he is in love with Hetty. He goes to the Hall Farm and finds '
                 'that Hetty seems more friendly towards him than in the past; '
                 "he doesn't realize that her thoughts are all of Arthur, and "
                 'his hopes rise. While visiting Bartle Massey, the local '
                 'schoolmaster, that evening, he learns that the keeper of the '
                 'Chase woods has had a stroke and that the job may be offered '
                 "to him. Adam's marriage prospects look bright indeed, both "
                 "from a financial and an emotional viewpoint. Arthur's "
                 'twenty-first birthday arrives, and all the tenants of the '
                 'estate gather for a grand celebration. There is a round of '
                 'toasts at dinnertime and everyone wishes the popular Arthur '
                 'well. Adam is offered the job as keeper of the woods and he '
                 'accepts it. There are games in which the townspeople compete '
                 'in the afternoon and a dance in the evening. At the dance, '
                 'Adam discovers by accident that Hetty is wearing a locket '
                 "which looks like a lover's token, but he dismisses the "
                 'thought that she is interested in another man. The locket, '
                 'of course, is a gift from Arthur; he and Hetty are carrying '
                 'on a secret affair. About three weeks later, Adam happens to '
                 'be passing through the grove on the Chase grounds when he '
                 'finds Arthur and Hetty in an embrace. He is furious, starts '
                 'a fight with Arthur, and knocks him out. When Arthur '
                 'revives, Adam forces him to promise to write a note to Hetty '
                 'breaking off the relationship. After much soul-searching, '
                 'Arthur composes the note and gives it to Adam to deliver. He '
                 'then leaves to join his regiment in the south of England. '
                 'Adam delivers the note, trying to soften the blow to Hetty '
                 'as much as possible. Before she reads the letter, Hetty '
                 'refuses to believe that Arthur wants to break off the '
                 'relationship; she is convinced that Arthur will marry her. '
                 'After she reads it, she is in despair. She wants to leave '
                 "home and go into service as a maid, but the Poysers won't "
                 'let her. Finally she begins to feel that marrying Adam '
                 "wouldn't be such a bad idea after all. Meanwhile, Dinah has "
                 'written a friendly letter to Seth from Snowfield, and Mrs. '
                 "Poyser has verbally routed Squire Donnithorne, Arthur's "
                 'grandfather, who was bent on making a sharp deal with '
                 "respect to the Poyser's farm. When Adam notices that Hetty's "
                 'friendly attitude toward him does not change, he concludes '
                 'that there had really been nothing serious between Arthur '
                 'and her. He proposes to her, she accepts, and the wedding is '
                 'set for the following spring. Adam is deliriously happy and '
                 'spends the next three months making preparations. Hetty, '
                 'meanwhile, has fits of depression and contemplates suicide; '
                 'she is pregnant by Arthur. She decides to run away and go to '
                 'Arthur; telling the Poysers that she is going to visit Dinah '
                 'in Snowfield for a week or two, she sets out. After '
                 'traveling for seven days, Hetty arrives sick, exhausted, and '
                 'penniless, at Windsor. Here she is befriended by an '
                 "innkeeper and his wife who inform her that Arthur's regiment "
                 'has left for Ireland. Hetty faints in despair, but the next '
                 'day her courage revives, she gets some money from the '
                 'innkeeper in exchange for the jewelry Arthur had given her, '
                 'and she heads back north, intending to go to Dinah in '
                 'Snowfield. After five days of traveling, though, her spirits '
                 'give out, and she leaves her coach and wanders out into the '
                 "open fields. She spends part of a night by a pond but can't "
                 'summon the courage to kill herself and so resumes her '
                 'journey on foot towards Stonyshire. When Hetty does not '
                 'return in the expected time, Adam decides to go to Snowfield '
                 'and bring her back. He discovers, of course, that she has '
                 'never been there, and he tries to trace her but to no avail. '
                 'Realizing that she has probably gone to Arthur, he resolves '
                 'to go to Ireland. He stops at the parsonage to tell Mr. '
                 'Irwine his plans and is shocked to learn that Hetty is in '
                 'prison in Stoniton for the murder of her baby. He and Mr. '
                 'Irwine go to Stoniton; Mr. Irwine returns the next day to '
                 'break the bad news to the Poysers, while Adam rents a room '
                 "and stays. Meanwhile, Arthur's grandfather has died and "
                 'Arthur has set out for home from Ireland. As the trial '
                 'begins, Adam sits in his room in despair. Mr. Irwine and '
                 'Bartle Massey (who has come to stay with Adam) bring news of '
                 "how the trial is progressing; Hetty's guilt seems certain, "
                 'though Adam refuses to believe it. Finally he goes to the '
                 'courtroom himself. Two witnesses give evidence against '
                 'Hetty, the jury returns the verdict of guilty, and the judge '
                 'pronounces the death sentence. Meanwhile, Arthur has '
                 'returned home, found a note from Mr. Irwine explaining the '
                 'situation, and left for Stoniton. On the evening after the '
                 'trial, Dinah comes to the prison and gains admittance; she '
                 'has been away and has just returned to the area. She gets '
                 'Hetty to confess her guilt, which the girl had refused to do '
                 'before, and induces her to pray. Dinah then goes and asks '
                 'Adam to come and see Hetty before she dies. He comes the '
                 'following morning, the day of the execution, and gives Hetty '
                 'the forgiveness she asks for. Then Hetty is taken away to '
                 'the place of execution. But at the last instant, Arthur '
                 "comes riding up with a reprieve; Hetty's sentence has been "
                 'commuted to "transportation" (exile). The next day, Adam and '
                 'Arthur meet by chance in the grove where they had fought. '
                 'Arthur is repentant and plans on going off to the wars. He '
                 "asks Adam's forgiveness, and Adam, after a short struggle "
                 'with his pride, agrees to shake hands. Eighteen months '
                 'later, Adam visits the Hall Farm to ask Dinah, who is '
                 'visiting her relatives again, to come and comfort his ailing '
                 'mother. Dinah goes back to the cottage with him and stays '
                 'overnight to help Lisbeth. She blushes when Adam speaks to '
                 'her. After she leaves, Lisbeth tells Adam that Dinah loves '
                 'him; Adam is taken by surprise, but when he thinks about it '
                 'he realizes that he loves her too. That afternoon he goes to '
                 'the Hall Farm and proposes; Dinah wants to say yes, but her '
                 'sense of duty stops her. She says she will return to her '
                 'work among the poor and think about it. Adam reluctantly '
                 'agrees and Dinah leaves. It is harvest time at the farm, and '
                 'the harvest supper takes place with great gaiety. After a '
                 "month or so, Adam becomes anxious to know Dinah's decision "
                 'and goes to Snowfield. He meets her atop a hill and she '
                 'accepts his proposal. After another month has passed, they '
                 'are married amid great rejoicing. Some years later, Dinah '
                 "and Seth are at home with Dinah's two children. Adam comes "
                 'home; he has been to see Arthur, who has been away all this '
                 'time and has returned a changed man. We learn that Hetty is '
                 'dead, and then the novel ends on a note of domestic '
                 'contentment.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'When Atreus died, the throne of Argos was inherited by his '
                 'son Agamemnon, who married Clytaemestra, the daughter of the '
                 'king of Sparta. They had three children — Iphigenia, '
                 'Electra, and Orestes. The other son of Atreus, Menelaus, '
                 'married Helen, the sister of Clytaemestra, and in due course '
                 'became the king of Sparta when her father died. Most of the '
                 'Greek chieftains had been among the suitors of Helen, for '
                 'she was renowned to be the most beautiful woman in the '
                 'world. They had made a pact to accept without protest her '
                 'choice of a husband and to come to his aid if anyone '
                 'attempted to steal Helen from him. Sometime after Helen and '
                 'Menelaus were married, Paris, the son of the king of Troy, '
                 'came to Sparta. He seduced Helen and carried her back with '
                 'him to Troy. Faithful to their oaths, the chieftains rallied '
                 'with their armies to the call of Menelaus. A great force was '
                 'mobilized to capture Troy and restore Helen to her rightful '
                 'husband. Agamemnon, as leader of the largest contingent, was '
                 'made commander. The expedition assembled at Aulis, on the '
                 'eastern coast of Greece, but was unable to sail for Troy '
                 'because of adverse winds. Calchas, a soothsayer who '
                 'accompanied the army, declared that the goddess Artemis was '
                 'responsible and could only be appeased by the sacrifice of '
                 "Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia. Agamemnon was appalled by "
                 'this command and refused to obey, but finally gave in to the '
                 'pressure put on him by the other chieftains. He induced '
                 'Clytaemestra to send Iphigenia to Aulis by claiming that the '
                 'maiden was to be married to Achilles, the greatest of the '
                 'Greek heroes. When the young girl arrived at the camp, '
                 'however, she was sacrificed to the goddess. After this the '
                 'wind changed. The army boarded its ships and set sail for '
                 'Troy. Meanwhile, Aegisthus returned to Argos in the absence '
                 'of Agamemnon. He began to plot against his cousin in the '
                 'hope of regaining what he considered to be his rightful '
                 'place on the throne, and of avenging the treatment his '
                 'father and brothers received at the hands of Atreus. '
                 'Aegisthus discovered that Clytaemestra had developed a '
                 'bitter hatred for Agamemnon because of the sacrifice of her '
                 'daughter. Her enmity for her husband continued to increase '
                 'as she received reports of his infidelity with other women '
                 'while on campaign at Troy. Before long, Aegisthus and '
                 'Clytaemestra became lovers. They shared the same hatred for '
                 'Agamemnon and began to conspire together. They planned to '
                 'murder him when he came back to Argos. The siege of Troy '
                 'lasted ten years. Finally the city fell and was sacked by '
                 'the Greek army, its temples were destroyed, and the '
                 'surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The first play '
                 'of the trilogy, Agamemnon, takes place in Argos shortly '
                 'after the fall of Troy. Agamemnon returns home with only one '
                 'ship because his fleet was scattered by a storm at sea. He '
                 'is accompanied by his newest concubine, Cassandra, the '
                 'daughter of the king of Troy. Aegisthus remains in the '
                 'background while Clytaemestra gives her husband an '
                 'affectionate welcome and the people of Argos applaud their '
                 'victorious king. Later, Clytaemestra traps Agamemnon in his '
                 'bath and kills him with an axe. Cassandra is murdered also. '
                 'Clytaemestra and Aegisthus announce the murders to the '
                 'people, overcome the opposition of the Elders, and set '
                 'themselves up as the new rulers of Argos. The action of The '
                 'Choephori, the second play, takes place a few years later. '
                 'Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, has been living in exile in '
                 'the nearby kingdom of Phocis. In obedience to a command '
                 'given him by the god Apollo, Orestes returns to Argos to '
                 'avenge his father. He seeks out his sister Electra, then '
                 'gains admittance to the palace by disguising himself and '
                 'kills Clytaemestra and Aegisthus. Orestes tries to justify '
                 'the murder of his mother, but in the final scene of the play '
                 'he is afflicted with madness and flees in terror from the '
                 'Furies, hideous spirits who hunt down and punish murderers. '
                 'The story of The Eumenides, the last play, begins a few days '
                 'later. Orestes seeks refuge in the sanctuary of Apollo at '
                 'Delphi. He is forced to wander as an outcast for the next '
                 'few years, with the Furies constantly tormenting him. '
                 'Finally he arrives at Athens and throws himself on the mercy '
                 'of the goddess Athene. The Furies follow him there and '
                 'insist that Orestes must be punished for matricide. He '
                 "claims that he acted according to Apollo's dictate and is "
                 'not responsible for the crime. Athene convenes a special '
                 'court to hear the case, but the jurors are unable to reach a '
                 'verdict. Athene casts the deciding vote and Orestes is '
                 'acquitted. The Furies angrily threaten vengeance on Athens, '
                 'but Athene clams them by the offer of a position of honor in '
                 'the cult of her city. They accept. The ancient Furies are '
                 'transformed into benevolent spirits. Their name is changed '
                 'to the Eumenides, or "kindly ones," to symbolize their new '
                 'character. The legends about the family of Atreus were among '
                 'the most popular in the Greek mythological heritage and many '
                 'versions of them were known in the ancient world. Some '
                 'elements of the story are recounted in the Odyssey of Homer. '
                 'Pindar and other poets made use of the legend also, and it '
                 'provided the plots for many tragedies in addition to the '
                 'trilogy by Aeschylus, including Electra by Sophocles, and '
                 'Electra, Orestes, Iphigenia at Aulis, and Iphigenia in '
                 'Tauris by Euripides. A complete account of the legend, with '
                 'reference to all its sources and variant versions, will be '
                 'found in Volume II of The Greek Myths by Robert Graves, '
                 'available in paperback edition, or in any other good '
                 'handbook of classical mythology.',

                 'read in an afternoon. Each of the brief chapters, '
                 'furthermore, is divided into small, individual, almost '
                 'isolated episodes. And the story begins with Alice and her '
                 'sister sitting on the bank of a river reading a book which '
                 'has no pictures or dialogue in it. " . . . and what is the '

                 'us, "If you don\'t know what a Gryphon is, look at the '
                 'picture." As noted earlier, Wonderland is filled with '
                 "strange animals, and Alice's encounters with these "
                 'creatures, all of whom engage her in conversations, confuse '
                 'her even more whenever she meets yet another inhabitant of '
                 "this strange country. Slowly losing interest in her sister's "
                 'book, Alice catches sight of a white rabbit. However, he is '
                 'not merely a rabbit; he will be the "White Rabbit," a major '
                 'character in the novel. In this first paragraph, then, we '
                 'learn about the protagonist, Alice, her age, her '
                 'temperament, and the setting and the mood of the story. In a '
                 'dream, Alice has escaped from the dull and boring and '
                 'prosaic world of adulthood — a world of dull prose and '
                 'pictureless experiences; she has entered what seems to be a '
                 'confusing, but perpetual springtime of physical, if often '
                 'terrifying, immediacy. The White Rabbit wears a waistcoat, '
                 'walks upright, speaks English, and is worrying over the time '
                 'on his pocket watch. Alice follows him simply because she is '
                 'very curious about him. And very soon she finds herself '
                 'falling down a deep tunnel. For a few minutes, she is '
                 'frightened; the experience of falling disorients her. Soon, '
                 'however, she realizes that she is not falling fast; instead, '
                 'she is falling in a slow, almost floating descent. As she '
                 'falls, she notices that the tunnel walls are lined with '
                 'cupboards, bookshelves, maps, and paintings. She takes a jar '
                 'of orange marmalade off a shelf. But finding the jar empty, '
                 'she replaces it on a lower shelf, as though she were trying '
                 'to maintain a sense of some propriety — especially in this '
                 'situation of absolute uncertainty. As she reflects on the '
                 'marmalade jar, she says that had she dropped the jar, she '
                 'might have killed someone below. Alice is clearly a '
                 "self-reflective young girl — and she's also relatively calm; "
                 'her thinking reveals a curiously mature mind at times. But '
                 'like an ordinary little girl, she feels homesick for her '
                 'cat, Dinah. In that respect, she is in sharp contrast with '
                 'conventional child heroines of the time. Although Alice may '
                 'be curious and sometimes bewildered, she is never too nice '
                 'or too naughty. But she is always aware of her class-status '
                 'as a "lady." At one point, she even fears that some of '
                 "Wonderland's creatures have confused her for a servant, as "
                 'when the White Rabbit thinks that she is his housekeeper, '
                 'Mary Ann, and orders Alice to fetch his gloves and fan. '
                 "Thus, in Chapter I, Carroll prepares us for Alice's first "
                 'major confrontation with absolute chaos. And note that '
                 "Alice's literal-minded reaction to the impossible is always "
                 'considered absurd here in Wonderland; it is laughable, yet '
                 'it is her only way of coping. As she falls through the '
                 'rabbit-hole, for instance, she wonders what latitude or '
                 'longitude she has arrived at. This is humorous and '
                 'ridiculous because such measurements — if one stops to think '
                 'about it — are meaningless words to a seven-year-old girl, '
                 'and they are certainly meaningless measurements of anything '
                 'underground. In Chapter II, Alice finds herself still in the '
                 'long passageway, and the White Rabbit appears and goes off '
                 'into a long, low hall full of locked doors. Behind one very '
                 'small door, Alice remembers that there is "the loveliest '
                 'garden you ever saw" (remember, she saw this in Chapter I), '
                 'but now she has drunk a liquid that has made her too large '
                 'to squeeze even her head through the doorway of the garden. '
                 'She wishes that she could fold herself up like a telescope '
                 'and enter. This wish becomes possible when she finds a '
                 'shrinking potion and a key to the door. The potion reduces '
                 'her to ten inches high, but she forgets to take the key with '
                 'her (!) before shrinking, and now the table is too high for '
                 'her to reach the key. To any young child, this is silly and '
                 "something to be laughed at, but on another level, there's an "
                 'element of fear; for children, the predictable proportions '
                 'of things are important matters of survival. Yet here in '
                 'Wonderland, things change — for no known reason — thus, '
                 'logic has lost all its validity. Then Alice eats a cake that '
                 'she finds, and her neck shoots up until it resembles a '
                 "giraffe's. Suddenly, she is a distorted nine feet tall! "
                 'Clearly, her ability to change size has been a mixed '
                 'blessing. In despair, she asks, "Who in the world am I?" '
                 'This is a key question. Meanwhile, the rapid, haphazard '
                 "nature of Alice's physical and emotional changes has created "
                 'a dangerous pool of tears that almost causes her to drown '
                 'when she shrinks again. Why has she shrunk? She realizes '
                 "that she has been holding the White Rabbit's lost white "
                 'gloves and fan — therefore, it must be the magic of the fan '
                 'that is causing her to shrink to almost nothingness. She '
                 'saves herself by instantly dropping the fan. But now she is '
                 'desperate; in vain, she searches her mind for something to '
                 'make sense out of all this illogical chaos, something like '
                 'arithmetic and geography, subjects that are solid, lasting, '
                 'and rational. But even they seem to be confused because no '
                 'matter how much she recites their rules, nothing helps. At '
                 'the close of this chapter, she is swimming desperately in a '
                 'pool of her own tears, alongside a mouse and other '
                 'chattering creatures that have suddenly, somehow, appeared. '
                 "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is full of parody and "
                 "satire. And in Chapter III, Victorian history is Carroll's "
                 'target. The mouse offers to dry the other creatures and '
                 'Alice by telling them a very dry history of England. Then, '
                 'Carroll attacks politics: the Dodo organizes a Caucus-race, '
                 'a special race in which every participant wins a prize. '
                 "Alice then learns the mouse's sad tale as Carroll's editor "
                 "narrates it on the page in the shape of a mouse's very "
                 'narrow, S-shaped tail. The assembled, unearthly creatures '
                 'cannot accept ordinary language, and so Alice experiences, '
                 'again, absolute bafflement; this is linguistic and semantic '
                 'disaster. Indeed, much of the humor of this chapter is based '
                 "on Alice's reactions to the collapse of three above-ground "
                 'assumptions: predictable growth, an absolute distinction '
                 'between animals and humans, and an identity that remains '
                 'constant. We might also add to the concept of a constancy of '
                 'identity a conformity of word usage. But in Wonderland, '
                 "Alice's previous identity and the very concept of a "
                 'permanent identity has repeatedly been destroyed, just as '
                 'the principles of above-ground are contradicted everywhere; '
                 'here in Wonderland, such things as space, size, and even '
                 'arithmetic are shown to have no consistent laws. In Chapter '
                 'IV, the confusion of identity continues. The White Rabbit '
                 'insists that Alice fetch him his gloves and his fan. '
                 'Somehow, he thinks that Alice is his servant, and Alice, '
                 'instead of objecting to his confusion, passively accepts her '
                 'new role, just as she would obey an adult ordering her about '
                 'above-ground. On this day when everything has gone wrong, '
                 "she feels absolutely defeated. In the rabbit's house, Alice "
                 'finds and drinks another growth potion. This time, however, '
                 'she becomes so enormous that she fills up the room so '
                 "entirely that she can't get out. These continuing changes in "
                 'size illustrate her confused, rapid identity crisis and her '
                 "continuous perplexity. After repulsing the rabbit's "
                 'manservant, young Bill, a Lizard (who is trying to evict '
                 'her), Alice notices that pebbles that are being thrown at '
                 'her through a window are turning into cakes. Upon eating one '
                 'of them, she shrinks until she is small enough to escape the '
                 "rabbit's house and hide in a thick wood. In Chapter V, "
                 '"Advice From a Caterpillar," Alice meets a rude Caterpillar; '
                 'pompously and dogmatically, he states that she must keep her '
                 'temper — which is even more confusing to her for she is a '
                 'little irritable because she simply cannot make any sense in '
                 'this world of Wonderland. Alice then becomes more polite, '
                 'but the Caterpillar only sharpens his already very short, '
                 'brusque replies. In Wonderland, there are obviously no '
                 "conventional rules of etiquette. Thus, Alice's attempt at "
                 'politeness and the observance of social niceties are still '
                 'frustrated attempts of hers to react as well as she can to '
                 "very unconventional behavior—at least, it's certainly "
                 'unconventional according to the rules that she learned '
                 'above-ground. Later, Alice suffers another bout of '
                 '"giraffe\'s neck" from nibbling one side of the mushroom '
                 'that the Caterpillar was sitting on. The effect of this '
                 'spurt upward causes her to be mistaken for an egg-eating '
                 'serpent by an angry, vicious pigeon. In Chapters VI and VII, '
                 'Alice meets the foul-tempered Duchess, a baby that slowly '
                 'changes into a pig, the famous, grinning Cheshire-Cat, the '
                 'March Hare, the Mad Hatter, and the very, very sleepy '
                 'Dormouse. The latter three are literally trapped (although '
                 "they don't know it) in a time-warp — trapped in a perpetual "
                 'time when tea is being forever served. Life is one long '
                 "tea-party, and this episode is Carroll's assault on the "
                 'notion of time. At the tea-party, it is always teatime; the '
                 "Mad Hatter's watch tells the day of the year, but not the "
                 "time since it is always six o'clock. At this point, it is "
                 'important that you notice a key aspect of Wonderland; here, '
                 'all these creatures treat Alice (and her reactions) as '
                 'though she is insane — and as though they are sane! In '
                 'addition, when they are not condescending to her or severely '
                 'criticizing her, the creatures continually contradict her. '
                 'And Alice passively presumes the fault to be hers — in '
                 'almost every case — because all of the creatures act as '
                 'though their madness is normal and not at all unusual. It is '
                 'the logical Alice who is the queer one. The chapter ends '
                 'with Alice at last entering the garden by eating more of the '
                 'mushroom that the Caterpillar was sitting on. Alice is now '
                 'about a foot tall. Chapters VIII to X introduce Alice to the '
                 'most grimly evil and most irrational people (and actions) in '
                 'the novel. Alice meets the sovereigns of Wonderland, who '
                 'display a perversely hilarious rudeness not matched by '
                 'anyone except possibly by the old screaming Duchess. The '
                 'garden is inhabited by playing cards (with arms and legs and '
                 'heads),who are ruled over by the barbarous Queen of Hearts. '
                 "The Queen's constant refrain and response to seemingly all "
                 'situations is: "Off with their heads!" This beautiful '
                 "garden, Alice discovers, is the Queen's private croquet "
                 'ground, and the Queen matter-of-factly orders Alice to play '
                 "croquet. Alice's confusion now turns to fear. Then she meets "
                 'the ugly Duchess again, as well as the White Rabbit, the '
                 'Cheshire-Cat, and a Gryphon introduces her to a Mock Turtle, '
                 'who sings her a sad tale of his mock (empty) education; then '
                 'the Mock Turtle teaches her and the Gryphon a dance called '
                 'the \'Lobster-Quadrille." Chapters XI and XII concern the '
                 'trial of the Knave of Hearts. Here, Alice plays a heroic '
                 'role at the trial, and she emerges from Wonderland and '
                 'awakens to reality. The last two chapters represent the '
                 "overthrow of Wonderland and Alice's triumphant rebellion "
                 'against the mayhem and madness that she experienced while '
                 'she was lost, for awhile, in the strange world of '
                 'Wonderland. This story is characterized, first of all, by '
                 "Alice's unthinking, irrational, and heedless jumping down "
                 'the rabbit-hole, an act which is at once superhuman and '
                 'beyond human experience — but Alice does it. And once we '
                 'accept this premise, we are ready for the rest of the '
                 "absurdities of Wonderland and Alice's attempts to understand "
                 'it and, finally, to escape from it. Confusion begins almost '
                 'immediately because Alice tries to use her world of '
                 'knowledge from the adult world above-ground in order to '
                 'understand this new world. Wonderland, however, is a lawless '
                 "world of deepest, bizarre dream unconsciousness, and Alice's "
                 'journey through it is a metaphorical search for experience. '
                 'What she discovers in her dream, though, is a more '
                 'meaningful and terrifying world than most conscious acts of '
                 'intelligence would ever lead her to. Hence, "Who in the '
                 'world am I?" is Alice\'s constant, confused refrain, one '
                 'which people "above-ground" ask themselves many, many times '
                 'throughout their lifetimes. Throughout the story, Alice is '
                 'confronted with the problem of shifting identity, as well as '
                 'being confronted with the anarchy and by the cruelty of '
                 'Wonderland. When Alice physically shrinks in size, she is '
                 'never really small enough to hide from the disagreeable '
                 'creatures that she meets; yet when she grows to adult or to '
                 'even larger size, she is still not large enough to command '
                 'authority. "There are things in Alice ," writes critic '
                 'William Empson, "that would give Freud the creeps." Often we '
                 'find poor Alice (and she is often described as being either '
                 '"poor" or "curious") in tears over something that the adult '
                 'reader finds comic. And "poor Alice" is on the verge of '
                 'tears most of the time. When she rarely prepares to laugh, '
                 'she is usually checked by the morbid, humorless types of '
                 'creatures whom she encounters in Wonderland. Not even the '
                 'smiling Cheshire-Cat is kind to her. Such a hostile '
                 'breakdown of the ordinary world is never funny to the child, '
                 'however comic it might appear to adults. But then Wonderland '
                 'would not be so amusing to us except in terms of its sheer, '
                 'unabated madness. One of the central concerns of Alice is '
                 'the subject of growing up — the anxieties and the mysteries '
                 'of personal identity as one matures. When Alice finds her '
                 'neck elongated, everything, in her words, becomes "queer"; '
                 'again, she is uncertain who she is. As is the case with most '
                 "children, Alice's identity depends upon her control of her "
                 "body. Until now, Alice's life has been very structured; now "
                 'her life shifts; it becomes fragmented until it ends with a '
                 'nightmarish awakening. Throughout the novel, Alice is filled '
                 'with unconscious feelings of morbidity, physical disgrace, '
                 'unfairness, and bizarre feelings about bodily functions. '
                 'Everywhere there is the absurd, unexplainable notion of '
                 'death and the absolute meaninglessness of death and life. '
                 "Alice's final triumph occurs when she outgrows nonsense. In "
                 "response to the Queen's cry at the Knave's trial: "
                 '"sentence first — verdict afterward," Alice responds: "Stuff '
                 "and nonsense! Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack "
                 'of cards!" At last, Alice takes control of her life and her '
                 'growth toward maturity by shattering and scattering the '
                 'absurdity of the playing cards and the silly little '
                 'creatures who are less rational than she is. In waking from '
                 'her nightmare, she realizes that reason can oppose nonsense, '
                 'and that it can — and did — win. And now that the dream of '

                 'enlistment in the army at the urging of their teacher, '
                 'Kantorek, whose wisdom they trusted. Paul Bäumer, a '
                 'sensitive teenager, serves as central intelligence, the '
                 'prototypical young infantryman whose youth is snatched away '
                 'by the brutality of war. Behind German front lines between '
                 'Langemark and Bixschoote in 1916, only eighty of the '
                 'original one hundred fifty soldiers of the Second Company '
                 'remain fit for duty. Paul and his comrades have acquired a '
                 'bit of battle experience, including the loss of Joseph Behm, '
                 'the first of their group to die. Franz Kemmerich, his leg '
                 'amputated, faces imminent death. A letter from Kantorek '
                 'calling them "Iron Youth" stirs Kropp\'s anger. The '
                 "soldiers, recalling Platoon 9's brutal basic training in "
                 'Klosterberg, abandon their idealism as a result of the '
                 'sadistic tutelage of Corporal Himmelstoss. In its place, '
                 'they evolve a strong comradeship, which bolsters and '
                 'protects them far better than the now useless information '
                 "they learned in school. Franz Kemmerich, Paul's friend, dies "

                 'boots. Kat, the shrewd, self-reliant scrounger, manages to '
                 'supply his friends with beans and beef. Paul and the others, '
                 "excited by news of Himmelstoss' arrival at the front, recall "
                 'the night before they left the training camp, when they '
                 'trapped their drill instructor in a bedspread and beat him. '
                 "Paul's unit, which includes some inexperienced recruits, "
                 'lays wire at the front. As they wait for return '
                 'transportation, a bombardment and poisonous gas barrage pin '
                 'them in a cemetery, churning up corpses from old graves. At '
                 'dawn, a truck returns the men to their billets. Himmelstoss '
                 'arrives and tries to ingratiate himself with his former '
                 'drill students. The men ignore and abuse him. Himmelstoss '
                 'succeeds in having Tjaden and Kropp punished for '
                 'insubordination. Kat and Paul thwart a guard dog and steal a '
                 'goose, which they roast and share with the others. Second '
                 'Company spends the summer near the front, fighting savagely '
                 'with grenades, bayonets, and sharpened shovels. The '
                 'thirty-two men who survive return to the rear in the fall to '
                 'rest. The company moves farther behind the lines than usual, '
                 'where they eat, sleep, and spend time with willing French '
                 'girls, whom they shower with gifts of food. Paul returns '
                 'home for a seventeen-day leave. Alienated by battle trauma, '
                 'he lacks ambition and is unable to enjoy the pleasures of '
                 "his youth. He despairs at his mother's weakness but enjoys "
                 'the humor of Mittelstaedt tormenting Kantorek, now a member '
                 'of the home guard and a poor specimen of a soldier. Paul '
                 'receives additional training at a camp on the moors, where '
                 'he observes the sufferings of Russian prisoners of war, who '
                 'must barter and scavenge garbage in order to stave off '
                 'hunger. He thinks of them as pathetic human beings rather '
                 'than adversaries and wishes that he could know them better. '
                 'Back with his unit, Paul feels more at home with comrades '
                 'than he did with family. Inspected by the Kaiser, Second '
                 'Company returns to the front. While on patrol, Paul becomes '
                 'separated from the others and fatally wounds Gérard Duval, a '
                 'French soldier, in self-defense. Face to face with a dying '
                 "enemy, Paul is remorseful and tries to ease the man's "
                 'sufferings. Returned to the dugout with his comrades, he '
                 'confesses to the killing, then calms himself by concluding '
                 'that "war is war." Paul\'s luck changes when he is assigned '
                 'to the supply depot and enjoys food and comfortable beds. '
                 'While evacuating a village, Paul and Kropp are shot and sent '
                 "by train to St. Vincenz Hospital. Kropp's leg is amputated. "
                 'Paul recovers and goes on leave, but sorry to leave his '
                 'friend behind, he returns to front-line duty. In the summer '
                 'of 1918, the war goes badly for Germany. Even rations, which '
                 'are adulterated with unwholesome additives, are in short '
                 'supply. Troops suffer dysentery and nervous exhaustion from '
                 'the seemingly endless assaults of the Allies. Paul is the '
                 'last remaining member of his schoolmates. He carries Kat to '
                 'an aid station to be treated for a shin wound. On the way, '
                 'Kat is hit in the head by a tiny splinter of shrapnel and '
                 'dies. Paul collapses. In October 1918, Paul, recently '
                 "returned from two weeks' leave to recover from poisonous "
                 'gas, is killed on a quiet day, shortly before armistice ends '

                 'near Del Rio and Langtry, All the Pretty Horses is a story '
                 'of loss and adventure. John Grady Cole, the main character, '
                 "is just 16 years old and attending his grandfather's funeral "
                 'when the novel opens. His mother and father are finally '
                 'divorcing after years of separation, and his mother is '
                 'determined to sell the ranch owned by her father. So John '
                 'Grady sets off on his horse, Redbo, accompanied by his best '
                 'friend Lacey Rawlins, on his horse, Junior. They ride south '
                 'across Texas, and, just north of the border, an even younger '
                 'runaway boy follows them on a big bay horse. Rawlins, the '
                 'realist, thinks Blevins, who has named himself after a radio '
                 'preacher, will be nothing but trouble; John Grady, the '
                 'idealist, is more sympathetic. Sticking together, the three '
                 'boys ride their horses naked across the Rio Grande River, '
                 'after securing their belongings in their tied-up pants. In a '
                 'lightning thunderstorm, Blevins loses everything except one '
                 'boot, but a few days later, when they see his horse in a '
                 'small town, Encantada, the three of them dare to reclaim it, '
                 'but, of course, they are followed. Blevins separates from '
                 'John Grady and Rawlins, who finally arrive at a beautiful '
                 'hacienda that they have heard about on their journey. They '
                 'find work as cowboys and wranglers, breaking sixteen wild '
                 'mustangs in four days, to earn their reputations. Soon, '
                 'because John Grady has proved his abilities with horses, he '
                 'is promoted to breeder for Senor Rocha, the hacienda owner. '
                 "A love story begins when the owner's daughter, Alejandra, a "
                 'year older than John Grady, seduces him. Rawlins tries to '
                 'warn his friend of the danger he is getting into by entering '
                 "a relationship with the owner's daughter. The two boys are "
                 'taken away in handcuffs at the end of Chapter II, when they '
                 "are caught by the men who saw them take Blevins' horse back "
                 'and accused of stealing. Rawlins is very angry with John '
                 'Grady, who defends himself by saying that some things '
                 "(meaning passionate love affairs) aren't reasonable. After "
                 'several days of hard riding, John Grady and Rawlins are put '
                 'in a small jail cell in an adobe building and find Blevins '
                 'there with broken feet. A fourth dweller in the cell, an old '
                 'man, tells the boys that Blevins has killed three men, but '
                 'Blevins says only one of the men died. After earning money '
                 'on a farm for two months, Blevins went back to Encantada to '
                 'retrieve his pistol. Having his horse was not enough for '
                 'Blevins, and his return to the town where he retrieved his '
                 'horse has now jeopardized three lives (his own, John '
                 "Grady's, and Rawlins'). During a transfer south to Saltillo "
                 'prison, Blevins is shot and killed in the woods. John Grady '
                 'and Rawlins, after much fighting in the Saltillo prison '
                 'yard, are both severely wounded. Finally, John Grady is '
                 'given an envelope of money by the commandant, and they are '
                 'released. They figure out that Duena Alfonsa, the great aunt '
                 'of Alejandra, the young girl John Grady loves, has bought '
                 'their freedom. Rawlins decides to go home to Texas by way of '
                 'Nuevo Larado, but John Grady wants to see Alejandra and also '
                 'try to get their horses back. Rawlins is afraid for John '
                 'Grady, who reassures him that he is not Blevins. John Grady '
                 'makes it to La Purisima where the great aunt tells John '
                 'Grady that Alejandra has promised never to see him again in '
                 'turn for her great-aunt sending the money to release him '
                 'from prison. The great-aunt, Duena Alfonsa, also tells John '
                 'Grady how he has disappointed Senor Rocha by lying and '
                 'denying any knowledge of Blevins. John Grady claims he '
                 "wasn't allowed to tell his side of the story, but she says "
                 'that does not matter. She gives him a horse and he rides to '
                 'Torreon where he calls Alejandra in Mexico City. She agrees '
                 'to meet him in Zacatecas, and they both take trains to meet '
                 'there. Despite their love and his entreaties, she refuses to '
                 'marry him. He gets drunk but makes his way back to Torreon '
                 'and the grullo horse, the wild one he first broke with '
                 'Rawlins a few months before. At a crossroads while riding '
                 'north, John Grady turns around and goes to the town where he '
                 'was first jailed and, by taking the captain hostage, he '
                 "retrieves his horse (Redbo), Rawlins' horse (Junior), and "
                 "Blevins' big bay. He has to let the wonderful grullo go, "
                 'because it is not strong enough for the long trip. But he '
                 'manages to cross into Texas, again near Langtry, the area of '
                 'Judge Roy Bean, where he travels for several months, trying '
                 'to find the rightful owner of the bay. A judge helps him '
                 'when some degenerates try to claim the horse. The judge '
                 "listens to John Grady's story and assures him that the man "
                 'he killed in prison and the captain who jailed them in the '
                 'small town are not good people. The judge tries to urge John '
                 'Grady to go easier on himself. In Del Rio, Texas, John Grady '
                 'visits the real Jimmy Blevins, who has never heard of anyone '
                 "fitting the boy's description and has never seen the horse. "
                 'After feeding John Grady a big meal and telling him about '
                 'the radio preaching business, the reverend goes off to write '
                 'a sermon. John Grady rides back to San Angelo and goes to '
                 "Rawlins' family place and whistles for his friend, who is "
                 'delighted to see John Grady and his horse, Junior. After '
                 'attending, on the sidelines, the funeral of the old woman, '
                 'Abuela, who had done most of the work raising him, John '
                 'Grady rides west, a lonely figure on one horse, leading his '
                 'second mount.',

                 'Helena, a beautiful woman, and her pursuit of a man of '
                 'higher social position than herself in the French court of '
                 'Rousillon. Helena is the daughter of a recently deceased '
                 'court physician; the man whom she pursues is Bertram, a '
                 'young man of the nobility, who is in mourning for his late '
                 'father, the Count. Helena follows Bertram to Paris where, as '
                 'a reward for "miraculously" curing the king of an apparently '
                 'terminal illness, she is granted the husband of her choice. '
                 'She chooses Bertram. Bertram at first refuses to have her, '
                 "but then he submits to the angry king's command — but only "
                 'outwardly. Together with his dubious "follower" Parolles, '
                 'Bertram flees France to fight in the Italian wars, where he '
                 'plans to achieve the necessary "honor" suitable to his rank. '
                 'Furthermore, he vows never to consummate his marriage with '
                 'Helena unless she can perform two "impossible" tasks: (1) '
                 '"get the ring upon [which is on] my finger," and (2) "show '
                 'me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to." Helena '
                 'does just that, with the help of a widow (whom she pays '
                 "handsomely) and the widow's virgin daughter, Diana. During "
                 'the well-known "bed trick," Bertram is fooled into believing '
                 'that he has made love to Diana, whereas, in reality, Helena '
                 'has smuggled herself into the bed. An exchange of rings also '
                 'takes place. Diana and Helena continue the ruse until the '
                 'last minutes of the play, when they surprise the entire '
                 'Parisian court (who think that Helena is dead), and they '
                 'then embarrass Bertram deeply when they reveal what has '
                 'transpired. But Helena finally has her man, and "all" has '
                 'apparently ended "well." In a comical subplot, another '
                 '"trick" is used, this time to reveal Parolles\' dishonesty '
                 'in the presence of Bertram; Parolles is taken captive, '
                 'blindfolded, and outrageous denunciations are extracted from '
                 'him about Bertram and others. But even Parolles is '
                 'grudgingly accepted back into the company at the end of the '
                 'play. Again, "all\'s well that ends well" — apparently.',

                 "love with Hermione, Pyrrhus' neglected fiancée, has "
                 'volunteered to head the mission, for he finds in it an '
                 'excellent pretext to see Hermione again and perhaps take her '
                 'back with him. First, however, he presents his demands to '
                 'Pyrrhus, who haughtily rejects them. But his refusal is '
                 "conditional on the love of Andromache. Aware of Pyrrhus' "
                 'hesitance, Hermione plans to return to her father, King '
                 'Menelaus. She informs Orestes of her decision to follow him '
                 'if Pyrrhus persists in defying the Greeks. Orestes briefly '
                 "rejoices until Pyrrhus, stung by Andromache's coldness, "
                 'decides to give in to his demands. Orestes, enraged by the '
                 'turn of events, plots to kidnap Hermione, who is unaware of '
                 'his plan. Andromache, meanwhile, pleads unsuccessfully with '
                 'Hermione to save her son. Then she turns to Pyrrhus, who '
                 'demands her hand in marriage in return for his protection. '
                 'Andromache, unable to come to a decision, goes to consult '
                 'the spirit of her husband at his tomb. Andromache has '
                 'decided to yield to Pyrrhus, but with a tragic private '
                 'reservation. She plans to kill herself directly after the '
                 'wedding ceremony. Hermione retaliates for her rejection by '
                 'Pyrrhus by imperiously demanding that Orestes kill Pyrrhus '
                 'at the altar. She is hardened in her resolution by a last '
                 'conversation with Pyrrhus, which confirms his indifference. '
                 "After Pyrrhus' departure, Hermione is violently torn between "
                 'love and resentment. Resentment wins out when Cleone, her '
                 "confidante, informs her of Pyrrhus' insulting happiness "
                 'during the marriage ceremony. Yet, far from rejoicing when '
                 "she hears Orestes' account of how the Greeks have avenged "
                 'her by killing Pyrrhus at the altar, she curses him and '
                 "stabs herself on Pyrrhus' body. Orestes is overwhelmed by "
                 'despair and then madness.',

                 'Count Vronsky, a dashing army officer who has no intentions '
                 'of marrying. Meeting the lovely Madame Karenina, Vronsky '
                 'falls in love and begins to pursue her. He and Anna are so '
                 "involved with each other at the grand ball that Kitty's "
                 'hopes for Vronsky are shattered. Anna, followed by Vronsky, '
                 'returns to her husband and son in St. Petersburg, while the '
                 'disappointed Levin returns to his country estate. Kitty '
                 'falls ill after her humiliating rejection by Vronsky. At the '
                 'German spa where she takes a rest cure she tries to deny her '
                 'womanly nature by becoming a religious do-gooder. Realizing '
                 'the hypocrisy of this new calling, Kitty returns to Russia '
                 'cured of her depression and ready to accept her ultimate '
                 'wifehood. Consummating her union with Vronsky, Anna steps '
                 'into a new life with much foreboding for the future. By the '
                 'time she confesses her adultery to the suspecting Karenin, '
                 "she is already pregnant with Vronsky's child. Devoting "
                 'himself to farming, Levin tries to find life meaningful '
                 'without marriage. He expends his energies in devising a '
                 'cooperative landholding system with his peasants to make the '
                 'best use of the land. Seeing his brother Nicolai hopelessly '
                 'ill with tuberculosis, he realizes he has been working to '
                 'avoid facing the problem of death. He also realizes he will '
                 "always love Kitty. Vronsky's career ambitions rival his "
                 'love, and as he has not chosen between them, he is still '
                 'uncommitted to Anna. Having rejected her husband, but still '
                 'unable to depend on Vronsky, Anna finds her situation '
                 'desperate. Her life is in a state of suspension. Kitty and '
                 'Levin are engaged to marry. Karenin, who has tried to '
                 'maintain appearances of domestic tranquillity, finally '
                 'builds up enough anger to hire a divorce lawyer. Anna is '
                 'confined of a daughter, but dangerously ill from puerperal '
                 'fever. At her deathbed, Karenin forgives her and feels '
                 'sanctified by this surge of humanity and Christian charity. '
                 'At this sudden reversal of their roles Vronsky feels so '
                 'humiliated he attempts suicide. These incidents form the '
                 "turning point of the novel. After Anna's recovery, the "
                 'lovers go abroad and Anna refuses divorce (though Karenin '
                 'agrees to it) for fear of giving up her son. Levin and '
                 'Kitty, after some initial difficulties, adjust to being '
                 "married. Nicolai's death affects Levin deeply, and he "
                 'realizes that emotional commitment, not reason, enables one '
                 "to overcome life's problems. As if to underscore his "
                 'life-affirmation, they learn Kitty is pregnant. After they '
                 'honeymoon in Italy, Anna and Vronsky return to Petersburg. '
                 "Violently affected from seeing her son again, Anna's love "
                 'for Vronsky becomes more desperate now that she has no one '
                 'else. Despite his objections, she boldly attends the theater '
                 'as if to affirm her love before conventional society. '
                 'Humiliated at the opera, she blames Vronsky for lacking '
                 'sympathy with her suffering, while he is angry at her '
                 'indiscretion. This keynotes the decline of their '
                 'relationship, although it is temporarily restored as they go '
                 "to live in the country. Among Levin's summer visitors is a "
                 'socialite who pays so much attention to Kitty that Levin '
                 "asks him to leave. Visiting Anna at Vronsky's estate, Dolly "
                 'finds her own drab life preferable to the formal luxury and '
                 "decadence of Anna's. Complaining that Vronsky is eager for "
                 'independence, Anna tells Dolly she must rely on her beauty '
                 'and her love to keep his interest. Vronsky feels especially '
                 "burdened by the demands of Anna's love when she calls him "
                 'home from a refreshing political convention. Kitty gives '
                 'birth to a son. Karenin, under the influence of his '
                 'fanatically devout friend, Countess Lydia Ivanovna, becomes '
                 'religious and uses his hypocritical faith as a crutch to '
                 'overcome his humiliation and loneliness. Anna, seeing the '
                 'irreversible decline of her love affair, has no more will to '
                 'live and commits suicide. Vronsky volunteers for service in '
                 'the Russo-Turkish war. Tolstoy uses this part of the novel '
                 'to express his pacifist principles. Levin discovers '
                 'salvation" when he resolves to "live for his soul" rather '
                 'than for selfish goals. He realizes the meaning of life '
                 'consists in living according to the goodness inherent in '
                 'every individual. Understanding death as part of a '
                 'reality-oriented life, Levin is at peace with himself.',

 'summary_text': 'The story of Anthem takes place in some unspecified future '
                 'time and place in which freedom and individual rights have '
                 'been obliterated. Collectivism — the political philosophy '
                 'holding that an individual exists solely to serve the state '
                 '— is dominant and has led to the establishment of a global '
                 'dictatorship of the Fascist or Communist variety. Equality '
                 '7-2521 is a Street Sweeper of the city, having been chosen '
                 'for this profession by the Council of Vocations. However, he '
                 'has always been fascinated by the phenomena of nature and '
                 "can't help but wonder what power of the sky causes lightning "
                 'and how it can be harnessed to human benefit. Because of his '
                 'fascination with the Science of Things, he secretly desires '
                 'to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. He has been taught '
                 'that it is a sin to harbor secret ambitions, and so believes '
                 'he is guilty, though strangely, he feels no pangs of '
                 'wrongdoing. One day while sweeping the streets, Equality '
                 '7-2521 comes upon a metal grill leading down into a dark '
                 'tunnel. The tunnel is clearly a remnant of the Unmentionable '
                 'Times, the ancient period prior to the establishment of the '
                 'present society. Equality 7-2521 sneaks to the tunnel alone '
                 'every night, where safe from others beneath the ground he '
                 'secretly performs scientific experiments. As the story '
                 'opens, this private research has been occurring for two '
                 'years. In that time, he also meets Liberty 5-3000. She is a '
                 'young woman who works in the fields and lives in the Home of '
                 'the Peasants beyond the city. Men and women are forbidden to '
                 'take notice of each other except at the Time of Mating, the '
                 'period each spring when the Council of Eugenics pairs off '
                 'men and women into couples for one night for the purpose of '
                 'procreating. But in his own mind, Equality 7-2521 takes such '
                 'notice of Liberty 5-3000 that he gives her a different name. '
                 'He thinks of her as the Golden One. He commits yet another '
                 'transgression by speaking to her, and it is clear that she '
                 'takes notice of him. He has forbidden thoughts. In the '
                 'night, he wonders about the Uncharted Forests that exist '
                 'across the land, covering the cities of the Unmentionable '
                 'Times. He thinks of the Script Fire in which the books of '
                 'the Evil Ones were burned, and he wonders about the secrets '
                 'of the Evil Ones that have been lost to the world. Mostly, '
                 'he wonders about the Unspeakable Word, the one idea held by '
                 'the Evil Ones that has been lost. He remembers the fate of '
                 'one who had discovered that word and had spoken it. His '
                 'tongue had been ripped out, and he was burned at the stake. '
                 'As a 10-year-old child, Equality 7-2521 had witnessed the '
                 'execution. The transgressor seemed noble, and the child had '
                 'thought that this was the face of one of the Saints about '
                 'whom children had been taught. To the young Equality 7-2521, '
                 'this Saint of the Pyre seemed to have gazed at him, picking '
                 'him out from the crowd of onlookers. What, he wonders late '
                 'at night, is the Unspeakable Word? In his experiments, '
                 'Equality 7-2521 discovers electricity. He uses it, after '
                 'much effort, to create an electric light. He thinks that '
                 'this light can be used to light the cities of the world. He '
                 'wishes to show it to others, but knows that they will not '
                 'understand and be frightened. In a month, the World Council '
                 'of Scholars meets in his city. He knows what to do. The '
                 'wisest minds among humankind will be there. They are the '
                 'only ones who can understand his gift. He will wait and show '
                 'it to them, and they will know how best to employ it for the '
                 'good of society. And he will be welcomed among them as one '
                 'of the Scholars. But when he demonstrates his invention, '
                 'they are frightened. They call him an "evil wretch" for '
                 'daring to think that a lowly Street Sweeper can possess '
                 'greater wisdom than that of the Council. He has broken all '
                 'the laws, and must be severely punished. Equality 7-2521 '
                 'acknowledges that they are right and does not care what '
                 'happens to him. But the light, he pleads. What will you do '
                 'with the light? They point out that he is alone in believing '
                 'that he has invented a great new product — and that what is '
                 'not believed by all cannot be true. They point out that if '
                 'he is right, then his discovery will bring ruin to the '
                 'Department of Candles and confusion to the Plans of the '
                 'World Council. For it took 50 years to get approval for the '
                 'candle from all the Councils, and to change the Plans again '
                 'so soon would be impossible. Their conclusion is unanimous: '
                 'The light is an evil thing and must be destroyed. Before '
                 'they can seize it, he takes it in his arms, smashes the '
                 'glass of the window with his fist and leaps through it. He '
                 'runs through the streets of the city, escaping to the '
                 "Uncharted Forest. He doesn't know where he is going — indeed "
                 'there is no place to go — but he must get away. He believes '
                 'that he will perish in the forest. He accepts that and is '
                 'not afraid, only he wishes to be away from the city and from '
                 '"air that touches upon the air of the city." He plunges '
                 'deeper into the Uncharted Forest. But he does not die. He '
                 'awakens on the first day in the forest with a realization of '
                 'freedom. There is no longer anyone to tell him what to do. '
                 'The next day, he hears footsteps behind him. He hides in the '
                 'bushes, but there is no need, for it is the Golden One. She '
                 'had heard of his escape, because the whole city is speaking '
                 'of it. On the night that she heard it, she bolted from the '
                 'Home of the Peasants and followed his trail through the '
                 'forest. She says she would rather be damned with him than '
                 'blessed with all her brothers. He takes her in his arms, and '
                 'that night he discovers that to make love to a woman is "the '
                 'one ecstasy granted to the race of men." He is frightened '
                 'only by the realization that he had lived for 21 years and '
                 'never known what joy is possible to men. They come upon an '
                 'abandoned home from the Unmentionable Times. They enter it '
                 'and wonder at the sights they behold — at the bright colors, '
                 'the mirrors, the clothes, and the books. Equality 7-2521 '
                 'declares that the home will be theirs. He finds that the '
                 'books are written in the language that he speaks, and he '
                 'reads them. In his reading, he discovers the word "I." When '
                 'he grasps its meaning, he cries tears of deliverance, '
                 'realizing that this is the holy word that humans have had '
                 'taken away from them. His reading teaches him that persons '
                 'are individuals, not splintered fragments of the group; they '
                 'have a right to pursue their happiness, and should not '
                 'sacrifice themselves for others; that they require freedom '
                 'to do this, and must not be enslaved by the group. When he '
                 'understands this, he takes for himself a name he finds in '
                 'his reading — Prometheus — the bringer of fire. The Golden '
                 'One takes the name of Gaea — the goddess who was the mother '
                 'of the earth. Gaea is pregnant with his child, who will be '
                 'the first-born of a new society of free humans. Equality '
                 '7-2521 learns that his light is powered by electricity, and '
                 'that the men of the Unmentionable Times had mastered it. He '
                 'will learn what they knew and use the knowledge to create '
                 'prosperity. He will build electric wires around his house to '

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'This act serves to introduce the main characters — Antony, '
                 'Cleopatra, and Octavius Caesar; it also outlines the main '
                 'forces which motivate each of them. The first scene is set '
                 "in Alexandria, where two of Antony's men, Demetrius and "
                 "Philo, describe the lovers' relationship. Caesar appears in "
                 'a later scene, and we see how he perceives Antony and '
                 "Cleopatra's relationship. In addition, his comments about "
                 'Antony reveal a great deal about his own character. We also '
                 'have ample evidence in this act that Antony and Cleopatra '
                 'are deeply in love, but Antony does not realize the tragic '
                 'possibilities of their infatuation, yet he is torn by '
                 'divided loyalties. In short, this first act sets out what '
                 'the relationships are among the main characters, and it '
                 'establishes the basic conflicts that dominate the rest of '
                 'the play: first, Antony and Cleopatra and their love for one '
                 "another; and second, Antony's rivalry with Caesar. In this "
                 'act, Shakespeare accelerates the inevitable final conflict '
                 'between his primary characters. Pompey, an insurgent force '
                 'against Rome, has become enough of a threat to the Roman '
                 'Empire that the triumvirs are forced to form a truce in '
                 'order to present a united front. Antony and Caesar decide to '
                 'resolve the fighting among themselves; this new "alliance" '
                 'is to be cemented by the marriage of Antony and Octavia, '
                 "Caesar's sister. When Cleopatra finds out that Antony has "
                 'married, she is devastated by the news. But she resolves not '
                 'to give up Antony so easily. In the meantime, even while '
                 'Antony pledges his loyalty to Octavia, his thoughts have '
                 'returned to Egypt and Cleopatra. Most of the main events of '
                 'the play have their beginnings in this act. It begins with '
                 "the continued efforts on Antony's part to work on behalf of "
                 'Rome and regain his stature in the world of politics and '
                 'war. But before long, he tires of the pursuit of power in '
                 'Rome and decides to return to Egypt. Octavia accompanies '
                 'Antony to Athens, but she returns to Rome alone after Antony '
                 "decides to return to Cleopatra. Octavia's disgrace gives "
                 'Caesar sufficient reason to hate Antony even more than he '
                 "already does, and he vows revenge. Octavia's discovery that "
                 'Antony is glorifying Cleopatra and her children, one of them '
                 'the illegitimate son of Julius Caesar, provides enough of an '
                 'excuse for Caesar to declare that both Antony and Cleopatra '
                 "are traitors. War begins, and Antony's forces are defeated; "
                 'the rest of the play focuses, thus, on the aftermath of this '
                 'battle and its effect on the love between Antony and '
                 'Cleopatra. Antony is at first despondent over his defeat. He '
                 'places the blame on Cleopatra, who fled with her ships. He '
                 'jeers that she will desert him for Caesar, just as some of '
                 'his troops already have. She convinces him that he is wrong, '
                 'and they courageously make one last attempt to defeat '
                 'Caesar. They win a battle, but their victory is short-lived, '
                 'and finally they are absolutely defeated. Again, Antony '
                 "doubts Cleopatra's loyalty, and so she flees to her "
                 'monument, the tomb where her body is to be buried after her '
                 'death. She hopes to make Antony see the error of his doubts '
                 'about her by sending him word that she is dead. Antony '
                 'suffers great remorse and falls upon his sword. He does not '
                 'die immediately, however, and he is taken to the monument, '
                 'where Cleopatra is waiting for him. They spend his final '
                 'moments together, and Cleopatra is left to face the Romans '
                 "alone. This final act concentrates on Cleopatra's last "
                 'hours, as she negotiates with the Roman victors. Caesar has '
                 'promised that she will be treated with honor in Rome, but '
                 "she has good reason not to believe him. One of Caesar's "
                 'officers, Dolabella, warns her not to put her faith in '
                 "Caesar's promises. Cleopatra resolves to die rather than be "
                 'taken captive to Rome, and she and her women have a basket '
                 'of poisonous snakes smuggled to them in order to commit '
                 'suicide. Thus, both Antony and Cleopatra die and they '
                 "ultimately deprive Caesar's final victory of its full glory, "
                 'as he finally acknowledges.',

 'summary_text': 'The play begins in the bedroom of Raina Petkoff in a '
                 'Bulgarian town in 1885, during the Serbo-Bulgarian War. As '
                 'the play opens, Catherine Petkoff and her daughter, Raina, '
                 'have just heard that the Bulgarians have scored a tremendous '
                 "victory in a cavalry charge led by Raina's fiancé, Major "
                 "Sergius Saranoff, who is in the same regiment as Raina's "
                 'father, Major Paul Petkoff. Raina is so impressed with the '
                 'noble deeds of her fiancé that she fears that she might '
                 'never be able to live up to his nobility. At this very '
                 'moment, the maid, Louka, rushes in with the news that the '
                 'Serbs are being chased through the streets and that it is '
                 'necessary to lock up the house and all of the windows. Raina '
                 'promises to do so later, and Louka leaves. But as Raina is '
                 'reading in bed, shots are heard, there is a noise at the '
                 'balcony window, and a bedraggled enemy soldier with a gun '
                 'appears and threatens to kill her if she makes a sound. '
                 'After the soldier and Raina exchange some words, Louka calls '
                 'from outside the door; she says that several soldiers want '
                 'to search the house and investigate a report that an enemy '
                 'Serbian soldier was seen climbing her balcony. When Raina '
                 'hears the news, she turns to the soldier. He says that he is '
                 'prepared to die, but he certainly plans to kill a few '
                 'Bulgarian soldiers in her bedroom before he dies. Thus, '
                 'Raina impetuously decides to hide him. The soldiers '
                 'investigate, find no one, and leave. Raina then calls the '
                 'man out from hiding; she nervously and absentmindedly sits '
                 'on his gun, but she learns that it is not loaded; the '
                 'soldier carries no cartridges. He explains that instead of '
                 'carrying bullets, he always carries chocolates into battle. '
                 'Furthermore, he is not an enemy; he is a Swiss, a '
                 'professional soldier hired by Serbia. Raina gives him the '
                 'last of her chocolate creams, which he devours, maintaining '
                 'that she has indeed saved his life. Now that the Bulgarian '
                 'soldiers are gone, Raina wants the "chocolate cream soldier" '
                 '(as she calls him) to climb back down the drainpipe, but he '
                 "refuses to; whereas he could climb up, he hasn't the "
                 'strength to climb down. When Raina goes after her mother to '
                 'help, the "chocolate cream soldier" crawls into Raina\'s bed '
                 'and falls instantly asleep. In fact, when they re-enter, he '
                 'is sleeping so soundly that they cannot awaken him. Act II '
                 "begins four months later in the garden of Major Petkoff's "
                 'house. The middle-aged servant Nicola is lecturing Louka on '
                 'the importance of having proper respect for the upper class, '
                 'but Louka has too independent a soul to ever be a "proper" '
                 'servant. She has higher plans for herself than to marry '
                 'someone like Nicola, who, she insists, has the "soul of a '
                 'servant." Major Petkoff arrives home from the war, and his '
                 'wife Catherine greets him with two bits of information: she '
                 'suggests that Bulgaria should have annexed Serbia, and she '
                 'tells him that she has had an electric bell installed in the '
                 "library. Major Sergius Saranoff, Raina's fiancé and leader "
                 'of the successful cavalry charge, arrives, and in the course '
                 'of discussing the end of the war, he and Major Petkoff '
                 'recount the now-famous story of how a Swiss soldier escaped '
                 'by climbing up a balcony and into the bedroom of a noble '
                 'Bulgarian woman. The women are shocked that such a crude '
                 'story would be told in front of them. When the Petkoffs go '
                 'into the house, Raina and Sergius discuss their love for one '
                 'another, and Raina romantically declares that the two of '
                 'them have found a "higher love." When Raina goes to get her '
                 'hat so that they can go for a walk, Louka comes in, and '
                 'Sergius asks if she knows how tiring it is to be involved '
                 'with a "higher love." Then he immediately tries to embrace '
                 'the attractive maid. Since he is being so blatantly '
                 'familiar, Louka declares that Miss Raina is no better than '
                 'she; Raina, she says, has been having an affair while '
                 'Sergius was away, but she refuses to tell Sergius who '
                 "Raina's lover is, even though Sergius accidently bruises "
                 "Louka's arm while trying to wrest a confession from her. "
                 'When he apologizes, Louka insists that he kiss her arm, but '
                 'Sergius refuses and, at that moment, Raina re-enters. '
                 'Sergius is then called away, and Catherine enters. The two '
                 'ladies discuss how incensed they both are that Sergius '
                 'related the tale about the escaping soldier. Raina, however, '
                 "doesn't care if Sergius hears about it; she is tired of his "
                 'stiff propriety. At that moment, Louka announces the '
                 'presence of a Swiss officer with a carpetbag, calling for '
                 'the lady of the house. His name is Captain Bluntschli. '
                 'Instantly, they both know he is the "chocolate cream '
                 'soldier" who is returning the Major\'s old coat that they '
                 'disguised him in. As they make rapid, desperate plans to '
                 'send him away, Major Petkoff hails Bluntschli and greets him '
                 'warmly as the person who aided them in the final '
                 'negotiations of the war; the old Major insists that '
                 'Bluntschli must their houseguest until he has to return to '
                 'Switzerland. Act III begins shortly after lunch and takes '
                 'place in the library. Captain Bluntschli is attending to a '
                 'large amount of confusing paperwork in a very efficient '
                 'manner, while Sergius and Major Petkoff merely observe. '
                 'Major Petkoff complains about a favorite old coat being '
                 'lost, but at that moment Catherine rings the new library '
                 'bell, sends Nicola after the coat, and astounds the Major by '
                 'thus retrieving his lost coat. When Raina and Bluntschli are '
                 'left alone, she compliments him on his looking so handsome '
                 'now that he is washed and brushed. Then she assumes a high '
                 'and noble tone and chides him concerning certain stories '
                 'which he has told and the fact that she has had to lie for '
                 'him. Bluntschli laughs at her "noble attitude" and says that '
                 'he is pleased with her demeanor. Raina is amused; she says '
                 'that Bluntschli is the first person to ever see through her '
                 "pretensions, but she is perplexed that he didn't feel into "
                 'the pockets of the old coat which she lent him; she had '
                 'placed a photo of herself there with the inscription "To my '
                 'Chocolate Cream Soldier." At this moment, a telegram is '
                 'brought to Bluntschli relating the death of his father and '
                 'the necessity of his coming home immediately to make '
                 'arrangements for the six hotels that he has inherited. As '
                 'Raina and Bluntschli leave the room, Louka comes in wearing '
                 'her sleeve in a ridiculous fashion so that her bruise will '
                 'be obvious. Sergius enters and asks if he can cure it now '
                 'with a kiss. Louka questions his true bravery; she wonders '
                 'if he has the courage to marry a woman who is socially '
                 'beneath him, even if he loved the woman. Sergius asserts '
                 'that he would, but he is now engaged to a girl so noble that '
                 'all such talk is absurd. Louka then lets him know that '
                 'Bluntschli is his rival and that Raina will marry the Swiss '
                 'soldier. Sergius is incensed. He sees Bluntschli and '
                 'immediately challenges him to a duel; then he retracts when '
                 'Raina comes in and accuses him of making love to Louka '
                 'merely to spy on her and Bluntschli. As they are arguing, '
                 'Bluntschli asks for Louka, who has been eavesdropping at the '
                 'door. She is brought in, Sergius apologizes to her, kisses '
                 'her hand, and thus they become engaged. Bluntschli asks '
                 "permission to become a suitor for Raina's hand, and when he "
                 'lists all of the possessions which he has (200 horses, 9600 '
                 'pairs of sheets, ten thousand knives and forks, etc.), '
                 'permission for the marriage is granted, and Bluntschli says '
                 'that he will return in two weeks to marry Raina. Succumbing '
                 'with pleasure, Raina gives a loving smile to her "chocolate '
                 'cream soldier."',

                 'work. Max Gottlieb loses his position on the faculty of '
                 'Winnemac and joins the Hunziker Pharmaceutical Company of '
                 'Pittsburgh, an institution criticized for unethical '
                 'practices. Martin is disappointed that his former professor '
                 'has formed such an alliance. The Tozer family and the '
                 'general unpleasant surroundings cause Martin to welcome a '
                 'chance to move on. This chance comes through his '
                 'acquaintance with Dr. Gustaf Sondelius, Swedish physician '
                 'and lecturer, who helps the young man obtain a position in '
                 "Nautilus. Martin's director in Nautilus, a town of seventy "
                 'thousand, is Dr. Almus Pickerbaugh, head of the Department '
                 'of Public Health, whose family consists of his wife and '
                 'eight daughters. The oldest, Orchid, greatly admires the '
                 'young physician. Martin is disappointed, however, when he '
                 'learns that a load of trivial duties will almost exclude any '
                 'intensive laboratory work. In Nautilus, Dr. Irving Watters, '
                 'formerly of Digamma Pi, is now a leading practitioner. '
                 'Pickerbaugh is nominated for Congress, and Martin takes '
                 'charge of the department while the candidate is campaigning. '
                 'Pickerbaugh is elected, and his leaving for Washington is '
                 'celebrated lavishly. Martin, too eager to free the town of '
                 'rats, fleas, and disease, incurs the disfavor of the '
                 'authorities and is practically forced to resign. He writes '
                 'to Angus Duer in Chicago. Duer, now a highly successful '
                 'surgeon, employs Martin in Rouncefield Clinic. For a year, '
                 'he is an impersonal part of a large organization. Then an '
                 'article which he publishes in a medical journal attracts the '
                 'attention of Max Gottlieb, now a research scientist at '
                 'McGurk Institute in New York. He offers Martin a position in '
                 'laboratory work, which the young man accepts. Gottlieb '
                 'advises Martin to study mathematics and physical chemistry '
                 'in order to prove his own experiments. On the McGurk staff '
                 'are also Dr. Rippleton Holabird, status-seeking head of the '
                 'department of physiology; Dr. Terry Wickett, a rude and '
                 'irritating seeker for scientific truth; and Dr. Tubbs, '
                 'Director of the Institute. America enters World War I in '
                 '1917, and work at the Institute is diverted to the war '
                 'effort. Gottlieb is unkindly treated because of his German '
                 "background. Martin's experiments with laboratory cultures "
                 'are dramatic. He discovers an X Principle, which will fight '
                 'and control a number of diseases. A French scientist, '
                 "D'Hérelle, of Pasteur Institute in Paris, has made the same "
                 'discovery, however, and his results are publicized before '
                 "Martin's. Consequently Martin loses the credit and can only "
                 "corroborate the findings of D'Hérelle. A year passes before "
                 'the bubonic plague breaks out in St. Hubert, an island in '
                 'the West Indies. Sondelius reappears and joins the staff of '
                 'McGurk. He and Martin become collaborators in search of a '
                 'cure for the plague. They are appointed by the Institute to '
                 'go to St. Hubert and experiment with the phage. Leora '
                 'insists on going along. Sondelius is to be charge of '
                 'sanitation, and Martin is to do the actual testing. Both '
                 'have explicit instructions from Gottlieb as to their '
                 'procedures. Conditions are much worse than expected on St. '
                 'Hubert. Martin wishes that he had forced Leora to stay '
                 'behind. He conducts his experiment but loses Leora and '
                 'Sondelius, both of whom die of the plague. Ira Hinkley, who '
                 'reappears in the West Indies, is also a victim. At the home '
                 'of an official, Martin meets Joyce Lanyon, who is later to '
                 'become his second wife. The plague is halted, and Martin '
                 'returns to New York alone, where he is received with much '
                 'acclaim by the press, the Public Health Service, and, of '
                 "course, McGurk Institute. Martin's subsequent marriage to "
                 'Joyce Lanyon brings him into a social world where the '
                 'emphasis is on money and position rather than on search for '
                 'truth. After several years of the marriage, during which a '
                 'son, John Arrowsmith, is born, Martin leaves Joyce to join '
                 'Terry Wickett in the Vermont hills, where, with a few other '
                 'research men, they can pursue their laboratory work in '
                 'seclusion and peace. Joyce will probably divorce her husband '
                 'and marry Latham Ireland, a friend of her first husband, '
                 'Roger Lanyon. So ends the story of Arrowsmith.',

                 'narration of the story shifts from one character to another. '
                 'While most sections are narrated by members of the Bundren '
                 'family, the few that are told by neighbors and other '
                 "observers offer a glimpse of the family from an outsider's "

                 'ineffectual husband, Anse, is arranging to have her buried '
                 'in Jefferson, a town forty miles away, because Addie has '

                 'health. Darl is perceptive and insightful but taunts others '
                 'mercilessly, while Jewel knows how to express love and '
                 'affection only through violence, because his mother sought '

                 'pregnant and in a hurry to get to Jefferson for an abortion. '

                 'Boys, complains to Adam, the old family retainer, that his '
                 'eldest brother, Oliver, has kept his Inheritance from him — '
                 'that is, Oliver has neglected training Orlando to be a '
                 'proper gentleman. Oliver arrives on the scene, and a bitter '
                 'quarrel takes place. Adam parts the fighting brothers, and '
                 'Oliver coldly promises to give Orlando his due. Learning '
                 "that Orlando intends to challenge Duke Frederick's champion "
                 'wrestler, a brute of a man called Charles, Oliver makes '
                 'plans to have his brother killed in the ring. He convinces '
                 'the slow-witted Charles that Orlando is plotting against him '
                 'and that Orlando should be killed. At the match the next '

                 'Rosalind, watch Charles and Orlando wrestle. Charles has '
                 'seriously injured his first three opponents, but in the '
                 "match with Orlando, the young man's great speed and agility "
                 "defeat the duke's champion. At first, Frederick is very "
                 "cordial to Orlando, but when he learns the youth's identity, "
                 'he becomes furious and leaves. The reason for the duke’s '
                 "leaving is that Orlando's dead father, Sir Roland de Boys, "
                 "had at one time been Frederick's bitter enemy. After "
                 'Frederick stalks out, Celia and Rosalind congratulate '
                 'Orlando, and Rosalind makes it clear that she finds him most '
                 'attractive. Orlando returns her feelings, but he is so '
                 'tongue-tied with embarrassment that he can say nothing. At '
                 'the ducal palace, we discover that Celia and her cousin '
                 'Rosalind are as close as sisters; Rosalind is the daughter '
                 'of the rightful duke, Duke Senior, whose throne has been '
                 'usurped by his brother, Frederick. Frederick has banished '
                 'Duke Senior, along with a band of his faithful followers, to '
                 'the Forest of Arden to live the life of simple foresters. '
                 'Until now, it is only the strong bond between Rosalind and '
                 'Celia that prevents Duke Frederick from sending Rosalind '
                 "away to share her father's exile. But suddenly, Frederick "
                 'storms into the palace, accuses Rosalind of plotting against '
                 "him, and, despite Celia's pleas for her cousin, banishes "
                 'Rosalind. After her father leaves, Celia decides to go into '
                 'exile with her cousin, and the girls set out for the Forest '
                 'of Arden — Rosalind disguised as a young man, "Ganymede," '
                 'and Celia disguised as a young country lass, "Aliena." '
                 "Touchstone, Frederick's jester, accompanies them. Meanwhile, "
                 'Orlando returns home and is warned by the faithful Adam that '
                 'Oliver is plotting to kill him. Together, they too decide to '
                 'set out for the Forest of Arden, hoping that they will find '
                 'safety there. When his daughter Celia is missed, Frederick '
                 'sends his men out to find Orlando. When he is informed of '
                 "Orlando's flight to the Forest of Arden, Frederick assumes "
                 "that Orlando is responsible for Celia's disappearance, and "
                 'in a rage he sends for Oliver and commands him to find '
                 'Orlando or else forfeit his entire estate to Frederick. In '
                 "the forest, Orlando and Adam join Rosalind's exiled father "
                 'and his men, while Rosalind and Celia, still in disguise, '
                 'purchase a little cottage and a small herd of sheep and '
                 'settle down to a peaceful, pastoral existence. One day, '
                 'however, Rosalind finds that the trees in the forest are all '
                 'covered with sheets of poetry, dedicated to her. The author '
                 'of these poems, of course, is Orlando. So, still pretending '
                 'to be the young man Ganymede, Rosalind meets Orlando, who is '
                 'in the throes of love-sickness for having apparently lost '
                 'Rosalind. Ganymede offers to cure Orlando of his '
                 'love-sickness by pretending to be his lady-love, Rosalind. '
                 'Orlando, she says, should woo Ganymede as though "he" were '
                 'Rosalind. In turn, Ganymede will do "his best" to act as '
                 'moody and capricious as a girl might just do and, '
                 'eventually, Orlando will weary of all the coy teasing and '
                 'forget all about love — and Rosalind. Orlando agrees to try '
                 'the plan. Rosalind, meanwhile, continues to assume the guise '
                 'of Ganymede and becomes accidentally involved in yet another '
                 'complication: Silvius, a young shepherd, falls in love with '
                 'Phebe, a hard-hearted shepherdess, but Phebe rejects '
                 "Silvius' attentions and falls in love with the young, "
                 'good-looking Ganymede. In the midst of all this confusion, '
                 'Oliver arrives in the Forest of Arden. He tells Ganymede of '
                 'a near escape he has just had with death. His brother, '
                 'Orlando, he says, saved him from being poisoned by a deadly '
                 'snake as he slept, and later, Orlando killed a lioness that '
                 'was ready to pounce on Oliver. Oliver then tells Ganymede '
                 'that he has been sent to this part of the forest to seek out '
                 'a young man known as Ganymede and tell him that Orlando '
                 'cannot keep his appointment with him. And there is more '
                 "news: while saving Oliver's life, Orlando was wounded. "
                 'Hearing this, Ganymede swoons. Later, in another part of the '
                 'forest, Oliver and Celia meet and fall in love at first '
                 'sight, and the jester, Touchstone, falls in love with a '
                 'homely, simple-minded young woman named Audrey, who tends a '
                 "herd of goats. Touchstone chases off Audrey's suitor, a lout "
                 'named William, and although he realizes that he will never '
                 'instill in Audrey any understanding of, or love for, such '
                 'things as poetry, he still feels that he must have her. Duke '
                 'Frederick, meanwhile, is alarmed by the daily exodus of so '
                 'many of the best men of his court to the alliance that is '
                 'growing in the Forest of Arden; he therefore decides to '
                 'journey to the forest himself and put a stop to all this '
                 "business. At the forest's edge, however, he meets an old "
                 'religious hermit and is miraculously converted. At this '
                 'point, Rosalind, still disguised as Ganymede, promises to '
                 'solve the problems of everyone by magic. Shedding her male '
                 'attire in private, she suddenly appears as herself, and the '
                 'play comes to a swift close as she and Orlando, Oliver and '
                 'Celia, Silvius and Phebe, and Touchstone and Audrey are '
                 "married. Rosalind's father, the rightful duke, is joyous at "
                 'finding his daughter again and is returned to his ducal '
                 "status. Frederick's conversion is so complete that he "
                 'renounces the world. At the end of the play, Rosalind comes '
                 'forward and addresses the audience in a short but charming '
                 'epilogue. In particular, she talks to all the lovers in the '

                 'booming industrial areas of Colorado. The country is in a '
                 'downward economic spiral with businesses closing and men out '
                 'of work. Other countries in the world have become socialist '
                 "Peoples' States and are destitute. Colorado, based on "
                 "Wyatt's innovative method of extracting oil from shale, is "
                 'the last great industrial center on earth. Dagny intends to '
                 'provide Colorado the train service it requires, but her '
                 'brother James Taggart, president of Taggart '
                 'Transcontinental, tries to block her from getting new rails '
                 'from Rearden Steel, the last reliable steel manufacturer. '
                 'James wants to do business with the inefficient Associated '
                 'Steel, which is run by his friend Orren Boyle. Dagny wants '
                 'the new rail to be made of Rearden Metal, a new alloy that '
                 'Hank Rearden developed after ten years of experiment. '
                 'Because the metal has never been tried and has been '
                 "denounced by metallurgists, James won't accept "
                 'responsibility for using it. Dagny, who studied engineering '
                 "in college, has seen the results of Rearden's tests. She "
                 'accepts the responsibility and orders the rails made of '
                 'Rearden Metal. Worsening the economic depression in the U.S. '
                 'is the unexplained phenomenon of talented men retiring and '
                 'disappearing. For example, Owen Kellogg, a bright young '
                 'Taggart employee for whom Dagny had great hopes, tells her '
                 'that he is leaving the railroad. McNamara, a contractor who '
                 'was supposed to rebuild the Rio Norte Line, retires '
                 'unexpectedly. As more great men disappear, the American '
                 'people become increasingly pessimistic. Dagny dislikes the '
                 'new phrase that has crept into the language and signifies '
                 "people's sense of futility and despair. Nobody knows the "
                 'origin or exact meaning of the question "Who is John Galt?," '
                 'but people use the unanswerable question to express their '
                 'sense of hopelessness. Dagny rejects the widespread '
                 'pessimism and finds a new contractor for the Rio Norte Line. '
                 'The crisis for Taggart Transcontinental worsens when the '
                 "railroad's San Sebastian Line proves to be worthless and is "
                 'nationalized by the Mexican government. The line, which cost '
                 'millions of dollars, was supposed to provide freight service '
                 'for the San Sebastian Mines, a new venture by Francisco '
                 "d'Anconia, the wealthiest copper industrialist in the world. "
                 "Francisco was Dagny's childhood friend and her former lover, "
                 'but she now regards him as a worthless playboy. In this '
                 "latest venture, d'Anconia has steered investors completely "
                 'wrong, causing huge financial losses and a general sense of '
                 'unrest. James Taggart, in an attempt to recover the '
                 "railroad's losses on the San Sebastian Line, uses his "
                 'political friendships to influence the vote of the National '
                 "Alliance of Railroads. The Alliance passes what's known as "
                 'the "Anti-dog-eat-dog rule," prohibiting "cutthroat" '
                 'competition. The rule puts the superb Phoenix-Durango '
                 "Railroad, Taggart Transcontinental's competitor for the "
                 'Colorado freight traffic, out of business. With the '
                 'Phoenix-Durango line gone, Dagny must rebuild the Rio Norte '
                 'Line quickly. Dagny asks Francisco, who is in New York, what '
                 'his purpose was in building the worthless Mexican mines. He '
                 "tells her that it was to damage d'Anconia Copper and Taggart "
                 'Transcontinental, as well as to cause secondary destructive '
                 'consequences. Dagny is dumbfounded, unable to reconcile such '
                 'a destructive purpose from the brilliant, productive '
                 'industrialist Francisco was just ten years earlier. Not long '
                 'after this conversation, Francisco appears at a celebration '
                 "for Hank Rearden's wedding anniversary. Rearden's wife "
                 'Lillian, his mother, and his brother are nonproductive '
                 'freeloaders who believe that the strong are morally obliged '
                 'to support the weak. Rearden no longer loves and cannot '
                 'respect them, but he pities their weakness and carries them '
                 'on his back. Francisco meets Rearden for the first time and '
                 'warns him that the freeloaders have a weapon that they are '
                 'using against him. Rearden questions why Francisco has come '
                 'to the party, but Francisco says that he merely wished to '
                 "become acquainted with Rearden. He won't explain his "
                 'presence any further. Although public opinion and an '
                 'incompetent contractor are working against them, Dagny and '
                 'Rearden build the Rio Norte Line. Rearden designs an '
                 'innovative bridge for the line that takes advantage of the '
                 'properties that his new metal possesses. The State Science '
                 'Institute, a government research organization, tries to '
                 'bribe and threaten Rearden to keep his metal off the market, '
                 "but he won't give in. The Institute then issues a statement "
                 'devoid of factual evidence that alleges possible weaknesses '
                 'in the structure of Rearden Metal. Taggart stock crashes, '
                 'the contractor quits, and the railroad union forbids its '
                 'employees to work on the Rio Norte Line. When Dr. Robert '
                 'Stadler, a brilliant theoretical scientist in whose name the '
                 'State Science Institute was founded, refuses to publicly '
                 'defend Rearden Metal even though he knows its value, Dagny '
                 'makes a decision. She tells her brother that she will take a '
                 'leave of absence, form her own company, and build the Rio '
                 'Norte Line on her own. She signs a contract saying that when '
                 "the line is successfully completed, she'll turn it back over "
                 'to Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny chooses to name it the '
                 'John Galt Line in defiance of the general pessimism that '
                 'surrounds her. Rearden and the leading businessmen of '
                 'Colorado invest in the John Galt Line. Rearden feels a '
                 'strong sexual attraction to Dagny but, because he regards '
                 "sex as a demeaning impulse, doesn't act on his attraction. "
                 'The government passes the Equalization of Opportunity Bill '
                 'that prevents an individual from owning companies in '
                 'different fields. The bill prohibits Rearden from owning the '
                 'mines that supply him with the raw materials he needs to '
                 'make Rearden Metal. However, Rearden creates a new design '
                 "for the John Galt Line's Rearden Metal Bridge, realizing "
                 'that if he combines a truss with an arch, it will enable him '
                 'to maximize the best qualities of the new metal. Dagny '
                 'completes construction of the Line ahead of schedule. She '
                 "and Rearden ride in the engine cab on the Line's first train "
                 'run, which is a resounding success. Rearden and Dagny have '
                 "dinner at Ellis Wyatt's home to celebrate. After dinner, "
                 'Dagny and Rearden make love for the first time. The next '
                 'day, Rearden is contemptuous of them both for what he '
                 'considers their low urges, but Dagny is radiantly happy. She '
                 "rejects Rearden's estimate, knowing that their sexual "
                 "attraction is based on mutual admiration for each other's "
                 'noblest qualities. Dagny and Rearden go on vacation '
                 'together, driving around the country looking at abandoned '
                 'factories. At the ruins of the Twentieth Century Motor '
                 "Company's factory in Wisconsin, they find the remnant of a "
                 'motor with the potential to change the world. The motor was '
                 'able to draw static electricity from the atmosphere and '
                 'convert it to usable energy, but now it is destroyed. '
                 'Realizing how much the motor would benefit the '
                 'transportation industry, Dagny vows to find the inventor. At '
                 'the same time, she must fight against new proposed '
                 'legislation. Various economic pressure groups, seeking to '
                 'cash in on the industrial success of Colorado, want the '
                 'government to force the successful companies to share their '
                 'profits. Dagny knows that the legislation would put Wyatt '
                 'Oil and the other Colorado companies out of business, '
                 'destroy the Rio Norte Line, and remove the profit she needs '
                 'to rebuild the rest of the transcontinental rail system, but '
                 "she's powerless to prevent the legislation. Dagny continues "
                 'her nationwide quest to find the inventor of the motor, and '
                 'she finally finds the widow of the engineer who ran the '
                 "automobile company's research department. The widow tells "
                 'Dagny that a young scientist working for her husband '
                 "invented the motor. She doesn't know his name, but she "
                 'provides a clue that leads Dagny to a cook in an isolated '
                 'Wyoming diner. The cook tells Dagny to forget the inventor '
                 "of the motor because he won't be found until he chooses. "
                 'Dagny is shocked to discover that the cook is Hugh Akston, '
                 "the world's greatest living philosopher. She goes to "
                 'Cheyenne and discovers that Wesley Mouch, the new economic '
                 'coordinator of the country, has issued a series of '
                 "directives that will result in the strangling of Colorado's "
                 'industrial success. Dagny rushes to Colorado but arrives too '
                 "late. Ellis Wyatt, in defiance of the government's edict, "
                 'set fire to his oil wells and retired. Months later, the '
                 'situation in Colorado continues to deteriorate. With the '
                 'Wyatt oil wells out of business, the economy struggles. '
                 'Several of the other major industrialists have retired and '
                 "disappeared; nobody knows where they've gone. Dagny is "
                 'forced to cut trains on the Colorado schedule. The one '
                 'bright spot of her work is her continued search for the '
                 'inventor of the motor. She speaks to Robert Stadler who '
                 'recommends a young scientist, Quentin Daniels of the Utah '
                 'Institute of Technology, as a man capable of undertaking the '
                 "motor's reconstruction. The State Science Institute orders "
                 '10,000 tons of Rearden Metal for a top-secret project, but '
                 'Rearden refuses to sell it to them. Rearden sells to Ken '
                 "Danagger, the country's best producer of coal, an amount of "
                 'Rearden Metal that the law deems illegal. Meanwhile, at the '
                 "reception for James Taggart's wedding, Francisco d'Anconia "
                 'publicly defends the morality of producing wealth. Rearden '
                 'overhears what Francisco says and finds himself increasingly '
                 'drawn to this supposedly worthless playboy. The day '
                 "following the reception, Rearden's wife discovers that he's "
                 "having an affair, but she doesn't know with whom. A "
                 'manipulator who seeks control over her husband, Lillian uses '
                 'guilt as a weapon against him. Dr. Ferris of the State '
                 'Science Institute tells Rearden that he knows of the illegal '
                 'sale to Ken Danagger and will take Rearden to trial if he '
                 'refuses to sell the Institute the metal it needs. Rearden '
                 'refuses, and the government brings charges against himself '
                 'and Danagger. Dagny, in the meantime, has become convinced '
                 'that a destroyer is loose in the world — some evil creature '
                 'that is deliberately luring away the brains of the world for '
                 'a purpose she cannot understand. Her diligent assistant, '
                 "Eddie Willers, knows that Dagny's fears are justified. He "
                 "eats his meals in the workers' cafeteria, where he has "
                 'befriended a nameless worker. Eddie tells the worker about '
                 "Dagny's fear that Danagger is next in line for the destroyer "
                 "— that he'll be the next to retire and disappear. Dagny "
                 'races to Pittsburgh to meet with Danagger to convince him to '
                 "stay, but she's too late. Someone has already met with "
                 'Danagger and convinced him to retire. In a mood of joyous '
                 'serenity, Danagger tells Dagny that nothing could convince '
                 'him to remain. The next day, he disappears. Francisco visits '
                 'Rearden and empathizes with the pain he has endured because '
                 'of the invention of Rearden Metal. Francisco begins to ask '
                 'Rearden what could make such suffering worthwhile when an '
                 "accident strikes one of Rearden's furnaces. Francisco and "
                 'Rearden race to the scene and work arduously to make the '
                 'necessary repairs. Afterward, when Rearden asks him to '
                 'finish his question, Francisco says that he knows the answer '
                 "and departs. At his trial, Rearden states that he doesn't "
                 'recognize his deal with Danagger as a criminal action and, '
                 "consequently, doesn't recognize the court's right to try "
                 'him. He says that a man has the right to own the product of '
                 'his effort and to trade it voluntarily with others. The '
                 'government has no moral basis for outlawing the voluntary '
                 'exchange of goods and services. The government, he says, has '
                 'the power to seize his metal by force, and they have the '
                 "power to compel him at the point of a gun. But he won't "
                 "cooperate with their demands, and he won't pretend that the "
                 'process is civil. If the government wishes to deal with men '
                 'by compulsion, it must do so openly. Rearden states that he '
                 "won't help the government pretend that his trial is anything "
                 'but the initiation of a forced seizure of his metal. He says '
                 "that he's proud of his metal, he's proud of his mills, he's "
                 "proud of every penny that he's earned by his own hard work, "
                 "and he'll not cooperate by voluntarily yielding one cent "
                 'that is his. Rearden says that the government will have to '
                 'seize his money and products by force, just like the robber '
                 'it is. At this point, the crowd bursts into applause. The '
                 'judges recognize the truth of what Rearden says and refuse '
                 'to stand before the American people as open thieves. In the '
                 'end, they fine Rearden and suspend the sentence. Because of '
                 'the new economic restrictions, the major Colorado '
                 'industrialists have all retired and disappeared. Freight '
                 'traffic has dwindled, and Taggart Transcontinental has been '
                 'forced to shut down the Rio Norte Line. The railroad is in '
                 'terrible condition: It is losing money, the government has '
                 'convinced James Taggart to grant wage raises, and there is '
                 'ominous talk that the railroad will be forced to cut '
                 'shipping rates. At the same time, Wesley Mouch is desperate '
                 'for Rearden to cooperate with the increasingly dictatorial '
                 "government. Because Rearden came to Taggart's wedding "
                 'celebration, Mouch believes that Taggart can influence '
                 'Rearden. Mouch implies that a trade is possible: If Taggart '
                 'can convince Rearden to cooperate, Mouch will prevent the '
                 'government from forcing a cut in shipping rates. Taggart '
                 'appeals to Lillian for help, and Lillian discovers that '
                 "Dagny Taggart is her husband's lover. In response to "
                 'devastating economic conditions, the government passes the '
                 'radical Directive 10-289, which requires that all workers '
                 'stay at their current jobs, all businesses remain open, and '
                 'all patents and inventions be voluntarily turned over to the '
                 'government. When she hears the news, Dagny resigns from the '
                 "railroad. Rearden doesn't resign from Rearden Steel, "
                 'however, because he has two weeks to sign the certificate '
                 'turning his metal over to the government, and he wants to be '
                 'there to refuse when the time is up. Dr. Floyd Ferris of the '
                 'State Science Institute comes to Rearden and says that the '
                 'government has evidence of his affair with Dagny Taggart and '
                 "will make it public — dragging Dagny's name through the "
                 'gutter — if he refuses to sign over his metal. Rearden now '
                 'knows that his desire for Dagny is the highest virtue he '
                 "possesses and is free of all guilt regarding it, but he's a "
                 'man who pays his own way. He knows that he should have '
                 'divorced Lillian long ago and openly declared his love for '
                 'Dagny. His guilt and error gave his enemies this weapon. He '
                 'must pay for his own error and not allow Dagny to suffer, so '
                 'he signs. Dagny has retreated to a hunting lodge in the '
                 "mountains that she inherited from her father. She's trying "
                 'to decide what to do with the rest of her life when word '
                 'reaches her that a train wreck of enormous proportions has '
                 'destroyed the famed Taggart Tunnel through the heart of the '
                 'Rockies, making all transcontinental traffic impossible on '
                 'the main track. She rushes back to New York to resume her '
                 'duties, and she reroutes all transcontinental traffic. She '
                 'receives a letter from Quentin Daniels telling her that, '
                 "because of Directive 10-289, he's quitting. Dagny plans to "
                 'go west to inspect the track and to talk to Daniels. On the '
                 'train ride west, Dagny rescues a hobo who is riding the '
                 'rails. He used to work for the Twentieth Century Motor '
                 'Company. He tells her that the company put into practice the '
                 'communist slogan, "From each according to his ability, to '
                 'each according to his need," a scheme that resulted in '
                 'enslaving the able to the unable. The first man to quit was '
                 'a young engineer, who walked out of a mass meeting saying '
                 'that he would put an end to this once and for all by '
                 '"stopping the motor of the world." The bum tells her that as '
                 'the years passed and they saw factories close, production '
                 'drop, and great minds retire and disappear, they began to '
                 'wonder if the young engineer, whose name was John Galt, '
                 "succeeded. On her trip west, Dagny's train is stalled when "
                 'the crew abandons it. She finds an airplane and continues on '
                 'to Utah to find Daniels, but she learns at the airport that '
                 'Daniels left with a visitor in a beautiful plane. Realizing '
                 'that the visitor is the "destroyer," she gives chase, flying '
                 'among the most inaccessible peaks of the Rockies. Her plane '
                 'crashes. Dagny finds herself in Atlantis, the hidden valley '
                 'to which the great minds have gone to escape the persecution '
                 'of a dictatorial government. She finds that John Galt does '
                 "exist and that he's the man she's been seeking in two ways: "
                 'He is both the inventor of the motor and the "destroyer," '
                 'the man draining the brains of the world. All the great men '
                 'she admires are here — inventors, industrialists, '
                 'philosophers, scientists, and artists. Dagny learns that the '
                 'brains are on strike. They refuse to think, create, and work '
                 'in a world that forces them to sacrifice themselves to '
                 "society. They're on strike against the creed of "
                 "self-sacrifice, in favor of a man's right to his own life. "
                 'Dagny falls in love with Galt, who has loved and watched her '
                 'for years. But Dagny is a scab, the most dangerous enemy of '
                 "the strike, and Galt won't touch her — yet. Dagny has the "
                 'choice to join the strike and remain in the valley or go '
                 'back to her railroad and the collapsing outside world. She '
                 'is torn, but she refuses to give up the railroad and '
                 "returns. Although Galt's friends don't want him to expose "
                 'himself to the danger, he returns as well, so he can be near '
                 "at hand when Dagny decides she's had enough. When she "
                 'returns, Dagny finds that the government has nationalized '
                 'the railroad industry and controls it under a Railroad '
                 'Unification Plan. Dagny can no longer make business '
                 'decisions based on matters of production and profit; she is '
                 'subject to the arbitrary whims of the dictators. The '
                 'government wants Dagny to make a reassuring speech to the '
                 'public on the radio and threatens her with the revelation of '
                 'her affair with Rearden. On the air, Dagny proudly states '
                 "that she was Rearden's lover and that he signed his metal "
                 'over to the government only because of a blackmail threat. '
                 'Before being cut off the air, Dagny succeeds in warning the '
                 'American people about the ruthless dictatorship that the '
                 'United States government is becoming. Because of the '
                 "government's socialist policies, the collapse of the U. S. "
                 "economy is imminent. Francisco d'Anconia destroys his "
                 'holdings and disappears because his properties worldwide are '
                 'about to be nationalized. He leaves the "looters" — the '
                 'parasites who feed off the producers — nothing, wiping out '
                 'millions of dollars belonging to corrupt American investors '
                 'like James Taggart. Meanwhile, politicians use their '
                 'economic power to create their own personal empires. In one '
                 'such scheme, the Taggart freight cars needed to haul the '
                 'Minnesota wheat harvest to market are diverted to a project '
                 'run by the relatives of powerful politicians. The wheat rots '
                 'at the Taggart stations, the farmers riot, farms shut down '
                 '(as do many of the companies providing them with equipment), '
                 'people lose their jobs, and severe food shortages result. '
                 'During an emergency breakdown at the Taggart Terminal in New '
                 'York City, Dagny finds that John Galt is one of the '
                 "railroad's unskilled laborers. She sees him in the crowd of "
                 'men ready to carry out her commands. After completing her '
                 'task, Dagny walks into the abandoned tunnels, knowing that '
                 'Galt will follow. They make love for the first time, and he '
                 'then returns to his mindless labor. The government smuggles '
                 "its men into Rearden's mills, pretending that they're "
                 'steelworkers. The union of steelworkers asks for a raise, '
                 'but the government refuses, making it sound as if the '
                 'refusal comes from Rearden. When Rearden rejects the Steel '
                 'Unification Plan the government wants to spring on him, they '
                 "use the thugs they've slipped into his mills to start a "
                 "riot. The pretense of protecting Rearden is the government's "
                 "excuse for taking over his mills. But Francisco d'Anconia, "
                 "under an assumed name, has taken a job at Rearden's mills. "
                 'He organizes the workers, and they successfully defend the '
                 "mills against the government's thugs. Afterward, Francisco "
                 'tells Rearden the rest of the things he wants him to know. '
                 'Rearden retires, disappears, and joins the strike. Mr. '
                 'Thompson, the head of state, is set to address the nation '
                 'regarding its dire economic conditions. But before he begins '
                 'to speak, he is preempted, cut off the air by a motor of '
                 'incalculable power. John Galt addresses the nation instead. '
                 'Galt informs citizens that the men of the mind are on '
                 'strike, that they require freedom of thought and action, and '
                 'that they refuse to work under the dictatorship in power. '
                 "The thinkers won't return, Galt says, until human society "
                 "recognizes an individual's right to live his own life. Only "
                 'when the moral code of self-sacrifice is rejected will the '
                 'thinkers be free to create, and only then will they return. '
                 'The government rulers are desperate. Frantically, they seek '
                 'John Galt. They want him to become economic dictator of the '
                 'country so the men of the mind will come back and save the '
                 'government, but Galt refuses. Realizing that Dagny thinks '
                 'the same way that Galt does, the government has her '
                 'followed. Mr. Thompson makes clear to Dagny that certain '
                 'members of the government fear and hate Galt, and that if '
                 'they find him first, they may kill him. Terrified, Dagny '
                 "goes to Galt's apartment to see if he's still alive. The "
                 "government's men follow her and take Galt into custody, and "
                 'the rulers attempt to convince Galt to take charge of the '
                 "country's economy. He refuses. They torture him, yet still "
                 'he refuses. In the end, the strikers come to his rescue. '
                 'Francisco and Rearden, joined now by Dagny, assault the '
                 'grounds of the State Science Institute where Galt is held '
                 'captive. They kill some guards and incapacitate others, '
                 'release Galt, and return to the valley. Dagny and Galt are '
                 "united. Shortly after, the final collapse of the looters' "
                 'regime occurs, and the men of the mind are free to return to '
                 'the world.',

 'summary_text': 'During the afternoon, Tom meets a boy from St. Louis with '
                 "whom he fights. That night at home, Tom's clothes are so "
                 'soiled from the fight that Aunt Polly punishes him by taking '
                 "away his Saturday's freedom and assigns him the unpleasant "
                 'task of whitewashing the fence. On Saturday morning, the '
                 'forlorn Tom begins his tedious task of whitewashing the '
                 'fence, fully aware that all of his friends are playing in '
                 "the town's square. As he begins his task, Aunt Polly's "
                 'slave, Jim, comes by and Tom tries to bribe him into '
                 'helping, but Aunt Polly sends Jim on his business. Suddenly, '
                 'Tom is horrified because one of his friends is about to come '
                 'by and see him actually working on a Saturday morning. Tom '
                 'pretends that what he is doing is not work because he is so '
                 'thoroughly enjoying himself. Soon Ben wants to try his hand '
                 'and offers Tom his apple. As Ben is painting, other friends '
                 'come by and also want to try their hands at this fun game. '
                 'Each boy gives Tom some sort of prize for allowing him to do '
                 'some whitewashing, and Tom ends up with his fence '
                 'whitewashed and a small treasury of gifts. After the fence '
                 'is painted, Tom heads for the square and, on the way, stops '
                 'to watch a very pretty young girl who is moving into a house '
                 'down the street. He shows off for her, and she pretends to '
                 'ignore him. He is attracted to her and finds out her name is '
                 'Becky Thatcher. He joins his friends in fun and games where '
                 'he is the leader of an army which defeats the opposing army. '
                 'The next day, Sunday, he is forced to attend Sunday school '
                 'and is bored with the tedium but finds ways to distract '
                 'himself. Monday, after offering many excuses for not going '
                 'to school, he is finally forced to go. On the way, he meets '
                 'Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunk. Huck never goes '
                 'to school and is the envy of all the boys because of his '
                 'complete freedom. Huck arranges for Tom to meet him that '
                 'night so they can bury a dead cat in the cemetery. At '
                 'school, Tom is punished for being late and is required to '
                 'sit in the "girls\' section." This pleases him because the '
                 'only empty seat is next to Becky Thatcher. At lunch, he '
                 'meets her, and they pledge their troth to each other. At '
                 'midnight, Huck arrives, and they go to the cemetery where '
                 'they come upon Dr. Robinson, Injun Joe, and Muff Potter who '
                 'are digging up a recently buried corpse. There is an '
                 'argument, Muff is knocked unconscious, and Injun Joe murders '
                 'the doctor and places the murder weapon next to Muff. The '
                 'horrified boys flee and take a blood oath never to reveal '
                 'what they have seen. The next day, the town is in an uproar '
                 '(school is dismissed), and Injun Joe identifies Muff Potter '
                 'as the murderer. Tom is fearful that Injun Joe will discover '
                 'that he was a witness. Tom, his friend Joe Harper, and Huck '
                 'Finn decide to become pirates. The three boys find a raft '
                 "and establish camp on Jackson's Island, where they enjoy a "
                 'carefree life of fishing, swimming, smoking, and exploring '
                 'and playing. When a steamboat filled with most of the '
                 'important townspeople passes by firing cannons over the '
                 'water, the boys realize that they are presumed to be '
                 'drowned. Tom sneaks home at night in order to leave Aunt '
                 'Polly a reassuring note that they are all right, but he '
                 'changes his mind when he overhears that church services are '
                 'planned for the "deceased boys" if they are not found by '
                 'Sunday. The funeral services are secretly attended by the '
                 'boys, and all rejoice when the dead boys casually stroll '
                 "down the aisle. Back at school, Tom finally wins Becky's "
                 'heart when he takes the blame for one of her indiscretions '
                 'and heroically suffers the punishment for her misdeeds. At '
                 "Muff Potter's trial, it is generally accepted that Muff "
                 'Potter killed Dr. Robinson and will be hanged. Tom, in spite '
                 'of his oath with Huck to not reveal what he has seen, cannot '
                 'stand to see an innocent person hanged for a crime he did '
                 'not commit. He bravely relates what actually happened. Injun '
                 'Joe makes his escape by jumping out the second story window. '
                 'One day, while Tom and Huck are looking for buried treasure, '
                 'they explore an old abandoned house. When two men arrive, '
                 'the boys are trapped upstairs. One man is Injun Joe in '
                 'disguise. The two criminals retrieve a box of silver coins '
                 'they had concealed and then, by chance, discover a horde of '
                 'gold coins that had been buried by some outlaws long ago. '
                 "They decide to take the gold coins to Injun Joe's other "
                 'hideout. The terrified boys overhear Injun Joe planning a '
                 'horrible revenge before leaving the country. The boys fear '
                 'that they are the subject of his planned vengeance but are '
                 'fortunate enough to narrowly escape detection. The boys try '
                 'to discover a place in town that would be the other hideout, '
                 'but they only find a room filled with an abundant supply of '
                 'whiskey in a Temperance Tavern. At the picnic celebrating '
                 "Becky Thatcher's birthday, several of the boys and girls "
                 "enter McDougal's Cave. Tom and Becky wander away from the "
                 'others in search of privacy and become hopelessly lost. '
                 'Meanwhile, Huck Finn, who is watching to discover Injun '
                 "Joe's hideout, follows the two men toward Cardiff Hill, the "
                 'home of the Widow Douglas and of a Welshman named Jones. '
                 'Hiding behind a bush, he overhears Injun Joe telling of his '
                 'intentions to mutilate the Widow Douglas because her '
                 'husband, the judge, had once had him publicly horsewhipped. '
                 'Huck hastens to inform Mr. Jones of the plot, and the '
                 'Welshman and his sons drive off the vicious Injun Joe and '
                 'his cohort. Huck has been so frightened that he becomes '
                 "seriously ill, and the Widow Douglas comes to the Welshman's "
                 'home and nurses the homeless boy back to health. At the same '
                 'time, it is discovered that Tom and Becky are missing; they '
                 'have not been seen since the cave. All the available men in '
                 'the community meet and carry out a thorough search of the '
                 'cave. Tom and Becky hear the search party in the distance '
                 'but are too weak to call loudly enough to be heard. At one '
                 'point in their ordeal, Tom catches sight of Injun Joe in a '
                 'nearby passage. After they have been underground for about '
                 'three days, Tom discovers a way out of the cave. He and '
                 'Becky then make their way back to the town. Both are sick '
                 'for a while, but Tom recovers more quickly than does Becky. '
                 'Tom also discovers that Judge Thatcher has had the second '
                 'exit to the cave completely sealed off. Tom reveals that '
                 "Injun Joe was in the cave. In spite of Injun Joe's evil, Tom "
                 'cannot let any human face the ordeal of starving that he and '
                 'Becky just endured. The men go back to the cave and discover '
                 "Injun Joe's body just inside the cave where he had futilely "
                 'tried to dig his way out with a knife. Later, Tom and Huck '

 'summary_text': 'All of old New York is at the ball, gossiping about the '
                 'Countess. Later, when the family plans a dinner to introduce '
                 'her to society, no one accepts. Without delay, the Mingott '
                 'family enlist the help of ancient social sages, Henry and '
                 'Louisa van der Luyden, to shore up support by inviting old '
                 'New York to a dinner it cannot refuse. In this way they '
                 'introduce the exotic Countess, and she finds New York '
                 'society charmingly narrow and provincial compared to Paris. '
                 "The next day Newland visits the Countess' small house in a "
                 'Bohemian section of town. He finds her drawing room exotic '
                 'and her friendship with shady financier Julius Beaufort '
                 'unsettling. But he senses her loneliness and, despite some '
                 'misgivings, sends her yellow roses. The Mingotts enlist '
                 "Newland's boss, Mr. Letterblair, to ask Newland to dissuade "
                 'the Countess from seeking a divorce. When Newland speaks '
                 'with Ellen — a passionate and exotic woman, unlike his '
                 'quiet, innocent May — he finds himself falling in love with '
                 'her, despite his engagement. Worried by temptation, Newland '
                 "flees to Florida where May's family is vacationing and asks "
                 'May to move the wedding date up. Startled, May tells him '
                 'that if there is "someone else," he may have his freedom. '
                 'Touched by her selflessness, Newland returns to New York. As '
                 'he confesses his love to Ellen, a telegram arrives from May, '
                 'saying that they can be married in a month. Newland knows '
                 'his duty. Book II of The Age of Innocence begins with May '
                 'marrying Newland as New York society watches. By August, a '
                 'year later, Newland and May have settled into a fashionable '
                 'if boring life in New York, living in a wealthy part of town '
                 'and spending summers with the rest of the rich in Newport. '
                 'Ellen has moved to Washington D.C.; she returns to stay with '
                 'her grandmother briefly, but later leaves to visit Boston. '
                 'Still under her spell, Newland lies to his wife and follows '
                 'Ellen there. Ellen promises to stay in America only if they '
                 'do not hurt May with a clandestine affair. She returns to '
                 "Washington. Meanwhile, Julius Beaufort's shady financial "
                 'dealings catch up with him, and his wife, Regina, appeals to '
                 "Ellen's grandmother for help. Mrs. Mingott suffers a stroke "
                 'and sends for Ellen to nurse her; during the two-hour '
                 'carriage ride with Ellen from the train station, Newland '
                 'suggests they have an affair. Ellen refuses, knowing that '
                 'will hurt May. He abruptly leaves the carriage and walks '
                 'home. Seeing May in the library, he realizes he will '
                 'dutifully stay married to her forever. Undaunted, the next '
                 'day Newland meets Ellen at the Metropolitan Museum, where '
                 'she finally agrees to a future one-time affair. Elated but '
                 'guilty, Newland decides to confess all to May, but she '
                 'interrupts to tell him that Ellen is leaving for Europe and '
                 'the Archers will give a farewell dinner for her. Shocked, '
                 'Newland intends to later follow Ellen. At the dinner, '
                 'however, he suddenly realizes that the entire family, '
                 'including May, thinks that he and Ellen are already having '
                 'an affair; giving Ellen the funds to live in Europe is the '
                 "family's way of dealing with the situation. That night as he "
                 'and May retire, she announces that she thought she was '
                 'pregnant and told Ellen earlier, before she was really sure. '
                 "But now she is sure, sealing Newland's fate forever. The "
                 'years pass. Newland is 57 and he and May have two grown '
                 'children: Dallas and Mary. May has recently died of '
                 'pneumonia, nursing a third child to health. Newland '

                 'tells Newland the Countess Ellen Olenska has invited them to '
                 'dine. Newland has not seen her in 26 years. Dallas confides '
                 "to his father May's deathbed confession that Newland "
                 'sacrificed the one thing he loved because of duty and honor. '
                 "That evening outside the Countess' apartment, Newland "
                 "encourages Dallas to go up without him. In Newland's memory, "
                 'their love stays forever young, perfect and unchanging over '

                 'abandoned church, Santiago, a shepherd boy, has a recurring '
                 'dream about a child who tells him that he will find a hidden '
                 'treasure if he travels to the Egyptian pyramids. An old '
                 'woman tells Santiago that this dream is prophetic and that '
                 'he must follow its instructions. Santiago is uncertain, '
                 'however, since he enjoys the life of a shepherd. Next '
                 'Santiago meets a mysterious old man who seems able to read '
                 'his mind. This man introduces himself as Melchizedek, or the '
                 'King of Salem. He tells Santiago about good and bad omens '
                 "and says that it is the shepherd boy's duty to pursue his "
                 'Personal Legend. Melchizedek then gives Santiago two stones, '
                 'Urim and Thummim, with which to interpret omens. Santiago '
                 'wavers briefly before selling his flock and purchasing a '
                 'ticket to Tangier, in northern Africa, to which he travels '
                 'by boat. Shortly after he arrives there, a thief steals all '
                 "of Santiago's money, so the shepherd boy decides to look for "
                 'a way to make enough money to return home. He finds work in '
                 'the shop of a crystal merchant, where Santiago makes '
                 'improvements that reap considerable financial rewards. After '
                 'eleven months of working in the shop, Santiago is unsure of '
                 'how to proceed. Should he return to Andalusia a rich man and '
                 'buy more sheep? Or should he cross the vast Sahara in '
                 'pursuit of the hidden treasure of his dreams? He joins a '
                 'caravan traveling to Egypt. Santiago meets an Englishman who '
                 'wants to learn the secret of alchemy, or turning any metal '
                 'into gold, from a famous alchemist who lives at an oasis on '
                 'the way to the pyramids. While traveling, Santiago begins '
                 'listening to the desert and discovering the Soul of the '
                 'World. The caravan eventually reaches the oasis, and there '
                 'Santiago meets an Arab girl named Fatima and falls in love '
                 'with her instantly. The caravan leader gathers the travelers '
                 'together and tells them that tribal warfare prevents them '
                 'from continuing their journey. Santiago wanders from the '
                 'oasis into the desert and, seeing two hawks fighting in the '
                 'sky, has a vision of an army entering the oasis. Because '
                 'attacking an oasis is a violation of the rules of the '
                 "desert, Santiago shares his vision with the oasis's tribal "
                 'chieftain. Soon afterward, Santiago is confronted by a '
                 'black-garbed, veiled stranger with a sword, who sits atop a '
                 'white horse. It is the alchemist. The tribal chieftain arms '
                 'his men, and they are well-prepared when the oasis is indeed '
                 'invaded. The alchemist offers to cross the desert with '
                 'Santiago. Soon the two men enter into an area of intense '
                 'tribal warfare. Warriors hold the two men captive, but '
                 'eventually allow them to continue their journey. The '
                 'alchemist tells Santiago that he needs to return to the '
                 "oasis, and that the rest of the trip is Santiago's to make "
                 'alone so that he can claim his Personal Legend. Santiago '
                 'arrives at the Egyptian pyramids and begins to dig. He finds '
                 'nothing buried in the ground. Thieves beat Santiago and rob '
                 'him of his money. After he tells them of his dream, though, '
                 'one of the thieves recounts his own dream about a buried '

 'summary_text': 'Upon his arrival in Europe, Christopher Newman begins to '
                 'visit the various art galleries. In Paris, he meets, in the '
                 'Louvre, a young girl who is making a copy of a great master. '
                 'He prefers the copy to the original and offers to buy it. '
                 'The young girl, Mademoiselle Noémie Nioche, sells it to him '
                 'at a much higher price than it is worth. While at the '
                 'Louvre, he meets an old acquaintance, Tom Tristram, whom he '
                 'knew during the Civil War. He tells Tristram how much money '
                 'he has made since the war and about his decision suddenly to '
                 'drop out of the business and travel in Europe. When he '
                 'suggests that he is on the lookout for a wife, Tristram '
                 'tells him that Mrs. Tristram could help him. After several '
                 'meetings, Mrs. Tristram suggests that he should court Madame '
                 'Claire de Cintré, a very proud and inaccessible young lady '
                 "who comes from one of Europe's oldest aristocracies. Later, "
                 'Newman accidently drops in and Madame de Cintré is just '
                 'leaving. She extends him an invitation to visit her, but '
                 'when Newman arrives two days later, he is told that she is '
                 'not at home. The next day, Monsieur Nioche brings Newman the '
                 'completed copy of the painting and is engaged to help Newman '
                 'with French. The mademoiselle is to do some more copies for '
                 'him. In a few days. Newman leaves on a tour of Europe during '
                 'which he meets with a young Unitarian minister from America. '
                 'They compare their reactions to Europe and the young '
                 'minister thinks that Newman is too liberal in his approach '
                 'to life and art. Upon his return to Paris, he calls on '
                 'Madame de Cintré and finds her home. He also meets her '
                 'brother Valentin and her sister-in-law, Marquise de '
                 'Bellegarde. He apparently makes something of an impression '
                 'on them. About a week later, Valentin pays Newman a visit. '
                 'They discuss many aspects of European life, but whenever '
                 'possible Newman brings the discussion around to Madame de '
                 'Cintré. After a few more visits, the two men become good '
                 'friends, and it is then that Newman tells Valentin that he '
                 'wishes to marry Claire de Cintré. Valentin is shocked and '
                 'thinks that Newman will not possibly be able to succeed, but '
                 'promises to help him. Thus, after more visits, and as soon '
                 'as possible, Newman proposes to Claire de Cintré. She is '
                 'somewhat surprised and asks him to say no more about the '
                 'subject for at least six months. Newman is encouraged '
                 "because she didn't openly refuse him. After the proposal, "
                 'Newman meets the mother and the older brother, who are the '
                 'head of the family. They are very cold and haughty, and look '
                 'upon Newman as some type of curiosity. But at a later '
                 'meeting, they tell him that he has permission to continue '
                 'seeing Claire de Cintré. One night at the opera, Newman '
                 'introduces Valentin to Noémie Nioche. He tells Newman that '
                 "the girl is not very honorable and that the girl's father "
                 'knows this and consents to it. Newman is shocked and '
                 "disagrees. Nevertheless, Valentin is intrigued by Noémie's "
                 'flirtatious charms. He plans to see her some more. Sometime '
                 'later, at a dinner party, Newman is introduced to Lord '
                 'Deepmere, a distant relative from England. Lord Deepmere '
                 'seems interested in Claire de Cintré. After the six months '
                 'have elapsed, Newman proposes once again to Claire de '
                 "Cintré, and to everyone's surprise, she accepts him. He "
                 'wants to give a party, but the Bellegardes say it is their '
                 'duty. At the ball, Newman is introduced to all of the '
                 'aristocracy of France. The grand duchess, the titular head '
                 'of European society, is delighted with Newman, but Newman is '
                 'so happy that he does not notice that Lord Deepmere spends '
                 'all of his time talking to Claire de Cintré. Shortly '
                 'afterwards, Newman is at the opera when he notices the '
                 'presence of Valentin and Noémie and another gentleman. After '
                 'a talk with them, Newman leaves. He later discovers that '
                 'Valentin is going to fight a duel with the strange man over '
                 'Noémie. Newman cannot understand this. The next time he '
                 'calls on Claire de Cintré, he finds her about to leave for '
                 'the country home. She explains that she had written him a '
                 'letter, but now tells him in person that she cannot marry '
                 'him. Newman feels that the older Bellegardes have gone back '
                 'on their promise. He wants to follow Claire de Cintré, but '
                 'he gets word that Valentin has been fatally wounded in the '
                 'duel and he must go to him. He finds Valentin still alive '
                 'and tells him what happened between him and Claire de '
                 'Cintré. Valentin is ashamed for his family and tells Newman '
                 'to go see the housekeeper, Mrs. Bread, who possesses some '
                 'type of knowledge which, if used properly, would force the '
                 'Bellegardes to keep their word. Newman goes to Claire de '
                 'Cintré and tries to persuade her to marry him in spite of '
                 'her family, but she tells him that she is resolved never to '
                 'marry, and is determined to become a Carmelite nun. Newman '
                 'goes to the Bellegardes and suggests that he has information '
                 'which could damage them if they do not live up to their side '
                 'of the bargain. They refuse Newman. He then goes to see Mrs. '
                 'Bread, the housekeeper who has always liked Newman and who '
                 'is strongly attached to Claire de Cintré. She tells him of a '
                 'letter that the old Marquis de Bellegarde wrote on his death '
                 'bed, telling how the son and wife had withheld his medicine '
                 'from him which caused his death. He charges them with '
                 "murder. Mrs. Bread then accepts Newman's offer to come and "
                 'be his housekeeper. She leaves the Bellegardes despite '

{'author': 'Benjamin Franklin',
 'book_title': 'The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Benjamin Franklin was the youngest son and 15th of 17 '
                 'children of Josiah Franklin, a soap and candle maker who had '
                 'immigrated to Boston from Northamptonshire, England. Because '
                 "he disliked his father's trade but loved reading, he was "
                 'apprenticed at the age of 12 to his brother James, a '
                 'printer. He and James often disagreed, and finally Benjamin '
                 'quit before his contract had expired. Looking for work, he '
                 'went first to New York and then to Philadelphia, where he '
                 'was hired by Samuel Keimer. Governor Keith of Pennsylvania '
                 'was impressed with Franklin and offered to set him up in '
                 'business. Assuming that Keith had placed letters of credit '
                 'for him on board his ship, Franklin sailed for England to '
                 'purchase his printing equipment, only to find that no such '
                 'letters had been written. He therefore was forced to spend '
                 'several months working in a London printing house. But he '
                 'returned home when a merchant named Denham offered him a '
                 "good job as clerk and manager of Denham's Philadelphia "
                 'store. A few months after they landed, however, Denham died, '
                 'and Keimer rehired Franklin as his manager. Eventually '
                 'Franklin set up a printing shop with one of the men he had '
                 "trained at Keimer's, Hugh Meredith. Later he bought "
                 "Meredith's share and found himself in business alone. He "
                 '"married" the girl whom he had courted before leaving for '
                 'England, Deborah Read, and the two prospered. Franklin '
                 'secured many valuable orders through his job as clerk of the '
                 'Pennsylvania Assembly. From his early years, Franklin '
                 'constantly struggled to improve himself. This passion '
                 'culminated in a plan to attain perfection in 13 weeks, by '
                 'unlearning bad habits and acquiring the 13 virtues Franklin '
                 'felt most important, one each week. He also outlined a '
                 'perfect day, allotting each necessary activity its proper '
                 "amount of time. But Franklin's passion for improvement was "
                 'not spent exclusively upon himself. Public projects to which '
                 "he turned his attention included Philadelphia's first public "
                 'library, fire company, public academy, philosophical '
                 'society, militia, defense system, and hospital. Besides '
                 "these projects, he helped improve the city's police system "
                 'and its streets (which he advocated paving), and devised a '
                 'more equitable tax system. The Autobiography ends as '
                 'Franklin wins his first skirmish while serving as '
                 "Pennsylvania's agent in England. Thus his account brings the "
                 "reader to the point at which Franklin's activity becomes "
                 'international in scope and the proper concern of '
                 'professional historians.',

 'book_title': 'The Awakening',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "The Awakening explores one woman's desire to find and live "
                 'fully within her true self. Her devotion to that purpose '
                 'causes friction with her friends and family, and also '
                 'conflicts with the dominant values of her time. Edna '
                 "Pontellier's story takes place in 1890s Louisiana, within "
                 'the upper-class Creole society. Edna, her husband Léonce, '
                 'and their two children are vacationing for the summer on '
                 'Grand Isle, an island just off the Louisiana shore near New '
                 'Orleans. They are staying at a pension , a sort of boarding '
                 'house where each family has their own cottage but eat '
                 'together in a main dining hall. Also staying at the pension '
                 'is the Ratignolle family; Madame Ratignolle is a close '
                 "friend of Edna's, although their philosophies and attitudes "
                 'toward child rearing differ fundamentally. Madame Ratignolle '
                 'is the epitome of a "mother-woman," gladly sacrificing a '
                 'distinct personal identity to devote her entire being to the '
                 'care of her children, husband, and household. In contrast to '
                 "Madame Ratignolle's character is Mademoiselle Reisz, a "
                 'brilliant pianist also vacationing on Grand Isle. Although '
                 'Mademoiselle Reisz offends almost everyone with her brutal '
                 'assessments of others, she likes Edna, and they become '
                 "friends. Mademoiselle Reisz's piano performance stirs Edna "
                 'deeply, awakening her capacity for passion and engendering '
                 'the process of personal discovery that Edna undertakes — '
                 'almost accidentally — that summer. Another Grand Isle '
                 'vacationer is the young and charming Robert Lebrun. Robert '
                 'devotes himself each summer season to a different woman, '
                 'usually married, in a sort of mock romance that no one takes '
                 'seriously. This summer, Edna is the object of his '
                 'attentions. As Edna begins the process of identifying her '
                 'true self, the self that exists apart from the identity she '
                 'maintains as a wife and mother, Robert unknowingly '
                 'encourages her by indulging her emerging sensuality. '
                 'Unexpectedly, Robert and Edna become intensely infatuated '
                 "with each other by summer's end. The sudden seriousness of "
                 'his romantic feelings for her compels him to follow through '
                 'on his oft-stated intention to go to Mexico to seek his '
                 'fortune. Edna is distraught at his departure, remaining '
                 'obsessed with him long after she and her family have '
                 'returned to New Orleans. As a result of her continuing '
                 'process of self-discovery, she becomes almost capricious in '
                 'meeting her desires and needs, no longer putting appearances '
                 'first. Always interested in art, she begins spending more '
                 'time painting and sketching portraits than on household and '
                 "social duties. Léonce is shocked by Edna's refusal to obey "
                 'social conventions. He consults Dr. Mandelet, an old family '
                 'friend, who advises Léonce to leave Edna alone and allow her '
                 'to get this odd behavior out of her system. Edna continues '
                 'her friendships with Mademoiselle Reisz and the pregnant '
                 'Madame Ratignolle. Mademoiselle Reisz receives letters from '
                 'Robert, which she allows Edna to read. Meanwhile, as a '
                 'result of her awakening sexuality Edna has an affair with '
                 'Alcée Arobin, a notorious womanizer. Her heart remains with '
                 'Robert, however, and she is delighted to learn that he is '
                 'soon returning to New Orleans. She has grown ever more '
                 'distant from Léonce, and also become a much better artist, '
                 'selling some of her work through her art teacher. These '
                 'sales provide her a small income, so while Léonce and the '
                 'children are out of town, she decides to move out of the '
                 'mansion they share and into a tiny rental house nearby, '
                 'called the "pigeon house" for its small size. Much to her '
                 'distress, she encounters Robert accidentally, when he comes '
                 'to visit Mademoiselle Reisz while Edna happens to be there. '
                 'She is hurt that he did not seek her out as soon as he '
                 'returned. Over the next weeks he tries to maintain emotional '
                 'and physical distance from Edna because she is a married '
                 'woman, but she ultimately forces the issue by kissing him, '
                 'and he confesses his love to her. Edna tries to express to '
                 'Robert that she is utterly indifferent to the social '
                 'prohibitions that forbid their love; she feels herself to be '
                 'an independent woman. Before she can explain herself, '
                 "however, she is called away to attend Madame Ratignolle's "
                 'labor and delivery, at the end of which Madame Ratignolle '
                 'asks Edna to consider the effect of her adulterous actions '
                 'on her children. Edna is greatly disturbed to realize that '
                 'her little boys will be deeply hurt if she leaves Léonce for '
                 'another man. To this point, she had considered only her own '
                 'desires. When she returns to the pigeon house, Robert is '
                 'gone, having left a goodbye note. Crushed, she decides to '
                 'kill herself, realizing that she cannot return to her former '
                 'life with Léonce but is also unwilling to hurt her children '
                 'personally or socially with the stigma of divorce or open '
                 'adultery. The next morning she travels alone to Grand Isle, '
                 'announces that she is going swimming, and drowns herself.',

                 "Shortly after Baby Suggs's death, Sethe's sons leave home, "
                 "unnerved by the presence of Beloved's ghost. Left with only "

                 'scene in which she mistakes Bodwin for a slave catcher and '
                 'tries to stab him with an ice pick. Beloved vanishes, and '
                 'Paul D returns, helping Sethe rediscover the value of life '
                 'and her own self-worth.',

 'summary_text': 'On the morning of September 17, 1799, Amasa Delano, the '
                 'captain of an American sealer, looks out on the bay of St. '
                 'Maria, a small, uninhabited island off Chile, and sees an '
                 'unidentified ship moving clumsily toward the harbor. To '
                 'assist the ship in safe passage, he travels by whale-boat to '
                 'the vessel, a handsome Spanish trader now fallen into '
                 "serious disrepair. His perusal of the ship's discipline "
                 'finds no officers, numerous black slaves milling about and '
                 'doing odd jobs, and the captain, Don Benito Cereno, too weak '
                 'and nervous to do much more than what his black servant '
                 'directs him. Cereno, who maintains a mysteriously evasive '
                 'veneer, explains that his men and passengers have been '
                 'depleted by scurvy, fever, and the buffeting of storms near '
                 'Cape Horn. Unable to maneuver the San Dominick to safe '
                 'mooring, they have been at the mercy of the sea. Captain '
                 'Delano, observing unusual glances and ambiguous remarks from '
                 'Spanish sailors, remains for a day to distribute much-needed '
                 'water and food to the crew and provide material for sails. '
                 'At the end of the day, Delano, planning to lend a navigator '
                 'from his own crew to help the ship on its way to Conception '
                 '(currently spelled "Concepcion"), descends to his boat to '
                 "return to the Bachelor's Delight. Don Benito, who has "
                 "rejected Delano's offer of coffee aboard Delano's ship, "
                 'suddenly leaps into the whale-boat and is soon followed by '
                 'Babo, his black slave, who indicates with upraised dagger '
                 'that he intends to kill his master. Delano realizes that Don '
                 'Benito is a prisoner and that the peculiar circumstances '
                 'aboard the San Dominick are an elaborate charade perpetrated '
                 'by rebels to make him believe that Don Benito is still in '
                 "charge. Led by Delano's mate, the Americans take possession "
                 'of the Spanish ship and render aid to the weakened captain. '
                 'The next month in Lima, the assembly testify before a royal '
                 'inquiry concerning the capture of the San Dominick. Don '
                 'Benito states in his deposition that, in May of 1799, the '
                 'San Dominick, on its way up the western coast of South '
                 'America to Lima, was overrun by black slaves, who had been '
                 'allowed to wander at will. The rebels, led by Babo and '
                 'Atufal, ordered the murder of some passengers and all but '
                 'six of the crew. They made an example of the slave dealer, '
                 'Don Alexandro Aranda, whom they mutilated, stabbed, then '
                 'stripped of flesh and nailed to the bow for a figurehead. '
                 'When the facts of the recapture of the San Dominick are '
                 'revealed, Babo is identified, hanged, and burned. His '
                 'severed head gazes from a pike above the plaza. Don Benito, '
                 'unable to shake off the horror he has undergone, retires to '

 'book_title': 'Beowulf',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Beowulf is the longest and greatest surviving Anglo-Saxon '
                 'poem. The setting of the epic is the sixth century in what '
                 'is now known as Denmark and southwestern Sweden. The poem '
                 'opens with a brief genealogy of the Scylding (Dane) royal '
                 'dynasty, named after a mythic hero, Scyld Scefing, who '
                 "reached the tribe's shores as a castaway babe on a ship "
                 "loaded with treasure. Scyld's funeral is a memorable early "
                 'ritual in the work, but focus soon shifts to the reign of '
                 'his great-grandson, Hrothgar, whose successful rule is '
                 'symbolized by a magnificent central mead-hall called Heorot. '
                 'For 12 years, a huge man-like ogre named Grendel, a '
                 'descendant of the biblical murderer Cain, has menaced the '
                 "aging Hrothgar, raiding Heorot and killing the king's thanes "
                 '(warriors). Grendel rules the mead-hall nightly. Beowulf, a '
                 'young warrior in Geatland (southwestern Sweden), comes to '
                 "the Scyldings' aid, bringing with him 14 of his finest men. "
                 "Hrothgar once sheltered Beowulf's father during a deadly "
                 'feud, and the mighty Geat hopes to return the favor while '
                 'enhancing his own reputation and gaining treasure for his '
                 'king, Hygelac . At a feast before nightfall of the first day '
                 'of the visit, an obnoxious, drunken Scylding named Unferth '
                 'insults Beowulf and claims that the Geat visitor once '
                 'embarrassingly lost a swimming contest to a boyhood '
                 'acquaintance named Breca and is no match for Grendel. '
                 'Beowulf responds with dignity while putting Unferth in his '
                 'place. In fact, the two swimmers were separated by a storm '
                 'on the fifth night of the contest, and Beowulf had slain '
                 'nine sea monsters before finally returning to shore. While '
                 'the Danes retire to safer sleeping quarters, Beowulf and the '
                 'Geats bed down in Heorot, fully aware that Grendel will '
                 'visit them. He does. Angered by the joy of the men in the '
                 'mead-hall, the ogre furiously bursts in on the Geats, '
                 'killing one and then reaching for Beowulf. With the strength '
                 "of 30 men in his hand-grip, Beowulf seizes the ogre's claw "
                 'and does not let go. The ensuing battle nearly destroys the '
                 'great hall, but Beowulf emerges victorious as he rips '
                 "Grendel's claw from its shoulder socket, sending the "
                 'mortally wounded beast fleeing to his mere (pool). The claw '
                 'trophy hangs high under the roof of Heorot. The Danes '
                 'celebrate the next day with a huge feast featuring '
                 'entertainment by Hrothgar\'s scop (pronounced "shop"), a '
                 'professional bard who accompanies himself on a harp and '
                 'sings or chants traditional lays such as an account of the '
                 "Danes' victory at Finnsburh. This bard also improvises a "
                 "song about Beowulf's victory. Hrothgar's wife, Queen "
                 'Wealhtheow, proves to be a perfect hostess, offering Beowulf '
                 'a gold collar and her gratitude. Filled with mead, wine, and '
                 'great food, the entire party retires for what they expect to '
                 "be the first peaceful night in years. But Grendel's mother — "
                 'not quite as powerful as her son but highly motivated — '
                 "climbs to Heorot that night, retrieves her son's claw, and "
                 'murderously abducts one of the Scyldings (Aeschere) while '
                 'Beowulf sleeps elsewhere. The next morning, Hrothgar, '
                 'Beowulf, and a retinue of Scyldings and Geats follow the '
                 "mother's tracks into a dark, forbidding swamp and to the "
                 "edge of her mere. The slaughtered Aeschere's head sits on a "
                 "cliff by the lake, which hides the ogres' underground cave. "
                 'Carrying a sword called Hrunting, a gift from the chastised '
                 'Unferth, Beowulf dives into the mere to seek the mother. '
                 "Near the bottom of the lake, Grendel's mother attacks and "
                 'hauls the Geat warrior to her dimly lit cave. Beowulf fights '
                 'back once inside the dry cavern, but the gift sword, '
                 "Hrunting, strong as it is, fails to penetrate the ogre's "
                 'hide. The mother moves to kill Beowulf with her knife, but '
                 'his armor, made by the legendary blacksmith Weland, protects '
                 'him. Suddenly Beowulf spots a magical, giant sword and uses '
                 "it to cut through the mother's spine at the neck, killing "
                 'her. A blessed light unexplainably illuminates the cavern, '
                 "disclosing Grendel's corpse and a great deal of treasure. "
                 'Beowulf decapitates the corpse. The magic sword melts to its '
                 "hilt. Beowulf returns to the lake's surface carrying the "
                 'head and hilt but leaving the treasure. After more '
                 'celebration and gifts and a sermon by Hrothgar warning of '
                 'the dangers of pride and the mutability of time, Beowulf and '
                 'his men return to Geatland. There he serves his king well '
                 'until Hygelac is killed in battle and his son dies in a '
                 'feud. Beowulf is then named king and rules successfully for '
                 '50 years. Like Hrothgar, however, his peace is shattered in '
                 'his declining years. Beowulf must battle one more demon. A '
                 'fiery dragon has become enraged because a lone fugitive has '
                 "inadvertently discovered the dragon's treasure-trove and "
                 'stolen a valuable cup. The dragon terrorizes the countryside '
                 "at night, burning several homes, including Beowulf's. Led by "
                 'the fugitive, Beowulf and eleven of his men seek out the '
                 "dragon's barrow. Beowulf insists on taking on the dragon "
                 'alone, but his own sword, Naegling , is no match for the '
                 'monster. Seeing his king in trouble, one thane, Wiglaf, goes '
                 'to his assistance. The others flee to the woods. Together, '
                 'Wiglaf and Beowulf kill the dragon, but the mighty king is '
                 'mortally wounded. Dying, Beowulf leaves his kingdom to '
                 'Wiglaf and requests that his body be cremated in a funeral '
                 'pyre and buried high on a seaside cliff where passing '
                 "sailors might see the barrow. The dragon's treasure-hoard is "
                 'buried with him. It is said that they lie there still.',

 'summary_text': 'Nearing home after a long voyage, the H.M.S. Bellipotent, a '
                 'British man-of-war in need of men, halts the merchant ship '
                 'Rights-of-Man. Lieutenant Ratcliffe impresses one — and only '
                 'one — sailor, Billy Budd, who is happy to serve his country '
                 'and offers no objections. As he leaves, he calls the Rights '
                 'of Man by name and bids farewell. Aboard the Bellipotent, '
                 'Billy assumes the duties of foretopman. He quickly endears '
                 'himself to his mates and the officers under whom he serves. '
                 'The captain of the ship, "Starry" Vere, is a quiet, just, '
                 'and well-read officer. In contrast, Claggart, the '
                 'master-of-arms, although outwardly placid, is inwardly '
                 'malevolent and moody. At first Claggart is friendly toward '
                 'Billy and seems pleased with his performance of duty. Later '
                 'Billy is surprised when he is admonished for petty errors. '
                 'Fearing punishment, Billy seeks advice from a veteran sailor '
                 'called the Dansker, who says Jemmy Legs (Claggart) is "down '
                 'on him [Billy]." The Dansker\'s observation proves correct. '
                 "Squeak, one of Claggart's corporals, furnishes desired false "
                 'information to the master-at-arms. One night, an '
                 'afterguardsman awakens Billy, who is sleeping on deck, and '
                 'dispatches him to a secluded spot on the ship. There he asks '
                 'Billy to join a group of impressed sailors in an '
                 'insurrection and offers him a bribe. Enraged, Billy begins '
                 'to stutter and threatens to throw the sailor overboard. The '
                 'sailor flees. Shortly after the Bellipotent gives chase to a '
                 'French vessel, the master-at-arms reports to Captain Vere '
                 'that Billy is involved in an attempted mutiny. Shocked, the '
                 'captain orders Claggart and Billy to come to his cabin. When '
                 'Claggart faces him with charges of conspiracy, Billy is so '
                 'dumbfounded that once again he is unable to speak; he can '
                 'only stammer. To vent his feelings, Billy strikes Claggart '
                 'so forcibly that he kills him. Captain Vere, in spite of his '
                 'love for Billy and his knowledge that the act was '
                 'unintentional, immediately calls a drumhead court to try the '
                 'foretopman. England is at war. During that same period there '
                 'have been widespread mutinies in the British fleet. The '
                 'officers panel finds Billy guilty. The next morning at '
                 'sunrise he is hanged from the yardarm. He dies with a '
                 'blessing on his lips — "God bless Captain Vere!" While '
                 'returning to join the Mediterranean fleet, the Bellipotent '
                 'encounters the French battleship Athée (the Atheist). In an '
                 'attempt to capture it, Captain Vere is seriously wounded. '
                 'The British vessel defeats the French ship and escorts it to '
                 'Gibraltar, where Captain Vere dies. In his last moments, the '
                 'captain murmurs, "Billy Budd, Billy Budd." Although Claggart '
                 'is exonerated and Billy Budd executed as a traitor, the '
                 'spirit of Billy Budd lives on. The common sailors remember '
                 "Billy's nobility. They keep track of the spar upon which "
                 'Billy was hanged. "To them a chip of it [is] as a piece of '
                 'the Cross." A fellow foretopman memorializes Billy in a '

 'summary_text': "Black Boy, an autobiography of Richard Wright's early life, "
                 "examines Richard's tortured years in the Jim Crow South from "
                 '1912 to 1927. In each chapter, Richard relates painful and '
                 'confusing memories that lead to a better understanding of '
                 'the man a black, Southern, American writer who eventually '
                 'emerges. Although Richard, as the narrator, maintains an '
                 'adult voice throughout the story, each chapter is told from '
                 'the perspective and knowledge that a child might possess. '
                 'Yet, because the narrative is told with such force and '
                 "honesty, the reliability of Richard's memories is not "
                 "questioned. By the story's end, as Richard comes of age, the "
                 'voice of the narrator and of the nineteen-year-old young man '
                 'he has become merge into one. The story begins when '
                 "four-year-old Richard sets fire to his grandmother's house "
                 'in Jackson, Mississippi, and, as punishment, is nearly '
                 'beaten to death by his mother. He recovers, and the brutal '
                 'punishment establishes in Richard an ability to survive any '
                 'circumstance. The family then moves to Memphis, Tennessee, '
                 "where Richard's father eventually deserts the family. In "
                 'Memphis, Richard learns about racism both from what he '
                 'observes in the world and how his family members humiliate '
                 'themselves in front of whites. It is also here that Richard '
                 'becomes alienated from God and the Christian faith, '
                 'developing in its place an abiding love of the natural '
                 'world. As Richard grows up, he begins to see how easily he '
                 'might repeat the patterns that have trapped black men for '
                 'generations. When his mother becomes ill, however, Richard '
                 'moves with her back to Jackson to live with his oppressive '
                 'grandmother. There, sees opportunities for breaking out of '
                 'his preordained life and avoid becoming trapped in it. He '
                 'also recognizes how religion can unite people along lines '
                 'other than skin color. Prayer also brings added value: '
                 'Although Richard is unable to talk to God when he prays, he '
                 'does find ideas for stories, thus beginning his life as a '
                 'writer. By age 12, Richard has alienated himself from most '
                 'of his family, which reinforces his role as an outsider, a '
                 'role he later finds is shared by many American writers. '
                 'Throughout the next several years, he excels at school but '
                 'feels detached from his classmates; he also lands a few '
                 'part-time jobs but feels alienated from his supervisors and '
                 'coworkers. Because Richard behaves differently than other '
                 'black children, the community tries to shame him into '
                 'submission, which he refuses. By age 16, Richard is '
                 'determined to be a writer, yet he is cognizant of the '
                 'dangers of a black youth having that aspiration while living '
                 'in the South, so he dreams of getting away and going North. '
                 'After graduation and another failed stint at a job, Richard '
                 'steals the money to go North. He is horrified by his crime '
                 'because it fulfills the expectations his extended family '
                 'holds for him. He also recognizes that crime produces '
                 'additional suffering in the world, and Richard wants to be a '
                 'part of social good, not social ills. With his stolen money, '
                 'Richard is able to move part-way north, back to Memphis, '
                 'where life is not radically different than in Jackson. After '
                 'an especially degrading incident at a new job, Richard '
                 'throws himself into reading novels and other works by '
                 'American and European writers. He realizes that he is '
                 'destined to become a writer and soon flees to Chicago. He '
                 'knows that the South will always be a part of him, but he is '
                 'determined to flourish in his new life, thus exacting '
                 "revenge on the Southern social system. Richard's "
                 'autobiography is continued in American Hunger, which was '
                 'published nearly two decades after his death in 1960. Black '
                 'Boy and American Hunger were published together for the '
                 'first time in 1991.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Black Elk Speaks , a personal narrative, has the '
                 'characteristics of several genres: autobiography, '
                 "testimonial, tribal history, and elegy. However, Neihardt's "
                 "editing and his daughter's transcription of Black Elk's "
                 "words, as well as Black Elk's son's original spoken "
                 "translation, raise questions about the narrative's "
                 'authenticity. Black Elk Speaks is divided into 25 chapters, '
                 "which depict Black Elk's early life. As an autobiography, "
                 "the narrative traces Black Elk's development as a healer and "
                 'holy man empowered by a mystical vision granted to him when '
                 'he was young. As a tribal history, it records the transition '
                 'of the Sioux nation from pre-reservation to reservation '
                 'culture, including their participation in the Battle of '
                 'Little Bighorn, the ghost dance, and the massacre at Wounded '
                 'Knee . Black Elk Speaks offers testimony to the price in '
                 'human suffering that the Sioux paid for the westward '
                 'expansion of the United States. As an elegy, it mourns the '
                 'passing of an age of innocence and freedom for the American '
                 'Indian and his current cultural displacement. Neihardt '
                 "frames Black Elk Speaks with his Preface and Author's "
                 'Postscript, which, though modest, remind readers of an '
                 'editing presence. In these two pieces, Neihardt describes '
                 'the circumstances of his conversation with Black Elk. '
                 'Chapters 1 and 2 are preliminary to the description of the '
                 "great vision in Chapter 3; they convey Black Elk's "
                 'confidence in Neihardt and record the first few years of '
                 "Black Elk's childhood, including the first time he heard "
                 'voices at age five. Chapter 3, the longest and most '
                 'complicated chapter of the book, describes the vision that '
                 'Black Elk was granted when he was nine years old. Highly '
                 "iconographic and symbolic, Black Elk's early vision depicts "
                 'his journey to a cloud world in the sky where six '
                 'grandfathers give him sacred objects and empower him to '
                 "maintain his people's sacred hoop. From this vision, Black "
                 'Elk gains a sense of himself as different from others in his '
                 'band in ways that are both privileged and unsettling. '
                 'Chapters 4 through 9 chart increasing tension between the '
                 'Sioux and white Americans, as settlement and commercial '
                 'enterprise expand westward into Indian territory. The '
                 'dislocation and loss of culture that the Sioux suffered as a '
                 'consequence of such events as the discovery of gold in '
                 'Montana and the building of the Transcontinental Railroad '
                 'erupts in the Battle of Little Bighorn, recorded in Chapter '
                 "9. Black Elk's narrative continues to recount the increasing "
                 'dislocation of the Sioux as the U.S. Government annexed more '
                 'and more Indian territory and established Indian agencies '
                 "and reservations. At the same time, Black Elk's vision "
                 'perplexes him because circumstances do not seem to allow him '
                 'to fulfill it. In Chapter 11, U.S. soldiers kill the great '
                 'warrior Crazy Horse, whose loss is a grave one for the '
                 'Sioux. In Chapter 12, Black Elk finds himself with a small '
                 'group of his people in virtual exile in Canada, trying to '
                 'avoid the inevitable reservation life. Chapters 13 through '
                 "18 record Black Elk's increasing anxiety about assuming his "
                 'role as healer and holy man. These chapters also depict the '
                 'performance of public rituals (the horse dance and the '
                 'heyoka ceremony) that allow Black Elk to assume his role '
                 'publicly. He has another vision, the dog vision, in Chapter '
                 '15, and in Chapter 17 performs his first cure. Chapters 19 '
                 "and 20 record Black Elk's experience in Chicago, New York, "
                 "and Europe, performing in Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West "
                 'Show. While in London, he participates in a command '
                 "performance to celebrate Queen Victoria's jubilee. He "
                 'becomes close to a young woman in Paris and suddenly falls '
                 "ill while visiting her. The girl's family take care of him "
                 'until he recovers. During his illness, he has another '
                 'vision. In Chapter 21, Black Elk comes home to an almost '
                 'totally displaced community, living on reservations, with '
                 'the bison herd all but extinct. The ghost dance religion '
                 "revives the Sioux; Chapters 21 and 22 chart Black Elk's "
                 'participation in that hope for an apocalypse. Chapters 23 '
                 'and 24 describe the death of Sitting Bull and the massacre '
                 'at Wounded Knee. Chapter 25 describes the aftermath of the '
                 "massacre and shows Black Elk's profound disappointment at "
                 'his failure to enact the power that his vision gave him.',

                 'maintains his ancestral home in rural Lincolnshire and also '
                 'a place in London. Lady Dedlock, his wife, "has beauty '
                 'still" at or near fifty but is proud and vain. She keeps a '
                 'secret unknown even to Sir Leicester. When she was young, '
                 'she bore an illegitimate child, a girl, to her lover, '
                 'Captain Hawdon. What she does not know, however, is that the '
                 'child is still alive. This daughter, now an adult, was given '
                 'the name Esther Summerson by the aunt who raised her. When '
                 'the aunt (Miss Barbary) dies, kindly, retired John Jarndyce '
                 "was appointed Esther's guardian. At the time of the story, "
                 "Esther is twenty and is traveling to Mr. Jarndyce's home, "
                 'Bleak House (which is cheerful and happy — not bleak). On '
                 'the journey, she has the companionship of his other two '
                 'wards, Ada Clare and Richard Carstone. Ada, Richard, and Mr. '
                 'Jamdyce are parties to a complicated, long-standing, and by '
                 'now obscure legal suit called Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Various '
                 'aspects of this entangled suit are heard from time to time '
                 'in the High Court of Chancery in London. The issues involve, '
                 'among other things, the apportionment of an inheritance. At '
                 'Bleak House, Esther notices that Richard Carstone has some '
                 'weaknesses of character yet remains likeable; she forms a '
                 'deep friendship with him as well as with the beautiful Ada. '
                 'She also notices that the two young people rather soon find '
                 'themselves in love. One "muddy, murky afternoon," while '
                 'looking at some legal documents, Lady Dedlock becomes '
                 'curious about the handwriting on them. She asks Mr. '
                 "Tulkinghorn, the Dedlocks' attorney, if he knows the hand. "
                 'Tulkinghorn, a corrupt and self-serving but clever lawyer, '
                 'does not, but eventually he discovers that the hand is that '
                 'of a certain "Nemo." A pauper without friends, "Nemo" has '
                 'been living in a dilapidated "rag-and-bottle" shop owned by '
                 'an old merchant, Krook. Tulkinghorn finds "Nemo" dead, '
                 'seemingly from too much opium. One person who knew the dead '
                 'man is little Jo, an urchin street sweeper. At an inquest, '
                 'Jo tells Tulkinghorn, "He [Nemo] wos wery good to me, he '
                 'wos!" Lady Dedlock knows that the handwriting is that of '
                 'Captain Hawdon. So, disguised as her own maid (Mlle. '
                 'Hortense), she finds Jo, who shows her where Hawdon is '
                 'buried. Tulkinghorn, looking always to his own advantage, '
                 'continues his keen interest in "Nemo" and is watchful of '
                 'Lady Dedlock. The maid Hortense detests Lady Dedlock and '
                 "helps Tulkinghorn ferret out the lady's secret. Tulkinghorn "
                 'reveals to Lady Dedlock that he knows about her child and '
                 'Captain Hawdon. He promises to keep his knowledge to '
                 'himself, but later he tells her that he no longer feels '
                 'bound to do so. Mille. Hortense, feeling used by '
                 'Tulkinghorn, turns against him. A short time later, '
                 'Tulkinghorn is found shot to death. A detective, Mr. Bucket, '
                 'is hired to investigate. The suspects include Lady Dedlock '

                 'soon as she turns twenty-one. Meanwhile, Esther and young '
                 'doctor Allan Woodcourt are attracted to each other but she '
                 'accepts a marriage proposal from Mr. Jarndyce. The waif Jo '
                 'contracts smallpox, and both Esther and her maid Charley '
                 'catch it from him; Esther survives but with a scarred face. '
                 'Shortly afterward, she learns that Lady Dedlock is her '
                 'mother. Feeling disgrace and remorse, Lady Dedlock dresses '
                 'like an ordinary working woman and wanders away. After an '
                 'intensive search, Esther and Detective Bucket find her lying '
                 'dead in the snow at the gates of the paupers cemetery, where '
                 'Captain Hawdon is buried. The case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce '
                 'is concluded at last, but legal fees have consumed all the '
                 'money that Richard Carstone would have inherited. He dies, '
                 'and, soon afterward, Ada gives birth to a boy, whom she '

                 'starting religious study for his first holy communion and is '
                 'becoming concerned with good and evil in the world. Early in '
                 'the novel, he witnesses the killing of Lupito, a war '
                 'veteran, and fears that his father may be punished by God '
                 'for being with the men who killed Lupito. Antonio is deeply '
                 "concerned about the fate of Lupito's soul. As the novel "
                 "develops, Antonio's fears and concerns intensify and become "
                 'woven together as he struggles to understand the events '
                 'surrounding his life. He becomes preoccupied with questions '
                 'about his destiny, life and death, and good and evil. Ultima '
                 'conveys an indigenous viewpoint to him that provides '
                 'guidance when he loses confidence in parental viewpoints and '
                 'the teachings of the Church. Ultima tells him the stories '
                 'and legends of his ancestors, and he comes to understand how '
                 'the history of his people stirs his blood. Through her, '
                 'Antonio learns the "old ways" and develops a new '
                 'relationship with nature. This relationship opens him to the '
                 'contemplation of the possibility of other gods. Antonio '
                 'learns there are powers in the world that differ from those '
                 'honored by the Catholic faith. He helps Ultima perform a '
                 'healing that saves the life of his Uncle Lucas, who had been '
                 'bewitched by the Trementina sisters. Later, he witnesses '
                 'another healing performed by Ultima and begins to understand '
                 'the world differently; he learns to overcome his fears, '
                 'especially his fear of change. In the end, Antonio '
                 'understands himself and the world around him better, and he '
                 'learns to accept life and the many challenges that it '
                 'presents.',

 'summary_text': 'Brave New World opens in London, nearly six hundred years in '
                 'the future ("After Ford"). Human life has been almost '
                 'entirely industrialized — controlled by a few people at the '
                 'top of a World State. The first scene, offering a tour of a '
                 'lab where human beings are created and conditioned according '
                 "to the society's strict caste system, establishes the "
                 'antiseptic tone and the theme of dehumanized life. The '
                 'natural processes of birth, aging, and death represent '
                 'horrors in this world. Bernard Marx, an Alpha-Plus (or '
                 'high-caste) psychologist, emerges as the single discontented '
                 'person in a world where material comfort and physical '
                 'pleasure — provided by the drug soma and recreational sex — '
                 'are the only concerns. Scorned by women, Bernard '
                 'nevertheless manages to engage the attention of Lenina '
                 'Crowne, a "pneumatic" beauty who agrees to spend a vacation '
                 'week with him at the remote Savage Reservation in New '
                 'Mexico, a place far from the controlled, technological world '
                 'of London. Before Bernard leaves, his superior, the D.H.C., '
                 'spontaneously reveals that long ago he, too, visited the '
                 'Savage Reservation, and he confesses in sorrow that he lost '
                 'the woman who accompanied him there. Embarrassed by the '
                 'disclosure of his socially unacceptable emotion, the D.H.C. '
                 'turns on Bernard, threatening him with banishment for his '
                 'own social sins — not engaging enthusiastically enough in '
                 'sex and soma . In the Savage Reservation with Lenina, '
                 'Bernard meets a woman from London who gave birth to a son '
                 'about 20 years before. Seeing his opportunity to gain power '
                 'over the D.H.C. — the father of the child — Bernard brings '
                 'Linda and John back to London and presents them publicly to '
                 'the D.H.C., who is about to banish Bernard. Shocked and '
                 'humiliated by the proof of his horrifying connection with '
                 'natural birth, the D.H.C. flees in terror. Once a social '
                 'outcast, Bernard now enjoys great success, because of his '
                 'association with the new celebrity — John, called "the '
                 'Savage." Reared on the traditional ways of the Reservation '
                 'and an old volume of the poetry of Shakespeare, John finds '
                 'London strange, confusing, and finally repellent. His '
                 'quotation of Miranda\'s line from The Tempest — "O brave new '
                 'world / That has such people in it" — at first expresses his '
                 'awe of the "Other Place" his mother told him of as a child. '
                 'But the quotation becomes ironic as John becomes more and '
                 'more disgusted by the recreational sex, soma , and identical '
                 "human beings of London. Lenina's attempted seduction "
                 "provokes John's anger and violence, and, later, the death of "
                 "Linda further arouses his fury. At last, John's attempt to "
                 'keep a crowd of Deltas from their ration of soma results in '
                 'a riot and his arrest, along with Bernard and Helmholtz '
                 'Watson, an "emotional engineer" who wishes to be a poet. The '
                 'three face the judgment of World Controller Mustapha Mond, '
                 'who acknowledges the flaws of this brave new world, but '
                 'pronounces the loss of freedom and individuality a small '
                 'price to pay for stability. Mond banishes Bernard and '
                 'Helmholtz to the Falkland Islands and rules that John must '
                 'stay in London. When his two friends leave for their exile, '
                 'John determines to make a retreat for himself in a remote, '
                 'secluded lighthouse outside the city. There he tries to '
                 'purify himself of civilization with ritual whippings and '
                 'vomiting. Drawn by the spectacle of his wild penances, '
                 'reporters and crowds press in on John, who becomes a public '
                 'curiosity — a kind of human animal in a zoo. When Lenina '
                 'appears in the crowd, John furiously attacks her with the '
                 "whip. John's frenzy inflames the crowd, and, in accordance "
                 'with their social training, the violence turns into a sexual '
                 'orgy, with John drawn in more or less unwillingly. The next '
                 'day, when John awakes from the effects of the soma , he '
                 'realizes in horror what he has done. The novel closes on an '
                 "image of John's body, hanging lifeless from a wooden beam in "
                 'his lighthouse retreat.',

{'author': 'Barbara Kingsolver',
 'book_title': 'The Bean Trees',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Barbara Kingsolver wrote The Bean Trees in shifting points '
                 'of view. All but two chapters of the novel are written in '
                 'the first person, revealing the thoughts and feelings of the '
                 'feisty protagonist, Taylor Greer. Kingsolver wrote Chapters '
                 '2 and 4 in limited third person (we see the character '
                 "through the author's eyes rather than through the "
                 "character's), presenting information as seen and understood "
                 'by Lou Ann Ruiz, a significant character in the novel. The '
                 'relationship that develops between Taylor and Lou Ann '
                 'becomes a focus of the novel. The Bean Trees begins when '
                 "Taylor (whose real name is Marietta) decides that it's time "
                 'to leave Pittman, Kentucky, where she lives with her mother, '
                 'and make something of herself. She buys a 1955 Volkswagen '
                 'and embarks on a personal journey of self-discovery, leaving '
                 'everything behind, including her name. When her car runs out '
                 'of gas in Taylorville, Illinois, she decides that her new '
                 'name will be Taylor. From that point on, she is known as '
                 'Taylor Greer. In the middle of Oklahoma, on land owned by '
                 "the Cherokee Nation, Taylor's car breaks down. Taylor stops "
                 'to have it repaired and to get something to eat at a '
                 'restaurant. Her life changes dramatically when, sitting in '
                 'her car and ready to leave the restaurant and continue '
                 'driving, a Cherokee woman puts a child wrapped in a blanket '
                 "on the front seat of Taylor's car. The woman asks Taylor to "
                 'take the child and then disappears in a pickup truck. Taylor '
                 "suspects that the child, who doesn't speak, has been "
                 'physically and sexually abused. Because the child holds onto '
                 "Taylor's clothing with a fiercely determined grip that "
                 "reminds Taylor of a mud turtle that won't let go of what it "
                 'has in its mouth, Taylor names the child Turtle. Kingsolver '
                 'introduces the perils of single motherhood as Taylor accepts '
                 'her newfound responsibilities and makes a commitment — '
                 'although Taylor is not fully aware that she has made such a '
                 'commitment — to care for another human being. Taylor and '
                 'Turtle travel to Tucson, Arizona. Because of additional car '
                 'problems, they end up at a business named Jesus Is Lord Used '
                 'Tires. The owner of the business, Mattie, a courageous and '
                 'kind person, eventually hires Taylor. Taylor soon discovers '
                 "that Mattie's shop is also a shelter for political refugees "
                 'from Guatemala. After she befriends refugees Estevan and '
                 'Esperanza, Taylor becomes more aware of discrimination and '
                 'social injustice. Looking for a place to live, taylor '
                 'responds to an ad in a newspaper and rents a room from Lou '
                 'Ann Ruiz. an immediate bond forms between Taylor and Lou Ann '
                 'when they realize that they both are from Kentucky. Lou Ann, '
                 'whose husband just left her, and her young son, Dwayne Ray, '
                 'and Taylor and Turtle provide a sense of family for each '
                 "other. The women's friendship, the relationships that they "
                 'develop with other characters, and the creation of a home in '
                 'an unexpected place provide the main themes in the novel. '
                 'Eventually, the secure environment and the love that Taylor '
                 'gives to Turtle pay off, and Turtle begins to speak. Her '
                 'first word is "bean," and subsequent words are the names of '
                 'vegetables. One day, when Turtle is in the park with Lou Ann '
                 "and Taylor's neighbor, Edna, who is almost completely blind, "
                 'someone grabs Turtle. Luckily, Edna has a cane and uses it '
                 'to whack the perpetrator, setting Turtle free. Following the '
                 'attack, Turtle withdraws and stops speaking. Because a '
                 'social worker becomes involved in the case, it is discovered '
                 'that Taylor has no legal right to Turtle and could lose her '
                 'to the state if relatives are not found. Taylor, whose bond '
                 'to Turtle is now no different than it would be if she were '
                 'her natural mother, vows to take whatever steps are '
                 'necessary to keep her daughter. Taylor, along with Turtle, '
                 'agrees to take Estevan and Esperanza to a safe house in '
                 "Oklahoma. Once in Oklahoma, Taylor tries to find Turtle's "
                 'relatives so that they can legally sign Turtle over to '
                 "Taylor's care. Unfortunately, Turtle's relatives cannot be "
                 'found. Unwilling to give up, Taylor asks Estevan and '
                 "Esperanza for their help. They pose as Turtle's parents and "
                 'express their wish to relinquish custody of their daughter '
                 'to their friend, Taylor. Taylor adopts Turtle and then takes '
                 'Estevan and Esperanza to the safe house. In the car on the '
                 'way home to Tucson, Turtle names vegetables, this time '

                 'Her father died when she was nine; while Esther wants to be '
                 'a poet, her mother wants her to learn shorthand so that she '

                 'and unable to enjoy her experiences in New York. During a '
                 'photo shoot for the magazine, she is unable to hold her '
                 'artificial smile, and begins weeping openly. Her final night '
                 'in the city, she goes on a date with Marco, a woman-hater '
                 'who begins the evening by giving her a diamond stickpin, and '
                 'later assaults her. He demands she return his diamond, which '
                 'was in her handbag; the handbag flew out of her hands and '
                 'landed somewhere in the mud during the assault. She leaves '
                 'Marco on his hands and knees in the mud, looking for his '
                 'diamond. She returns to her hotel room and, one by one, '
                 'drops her clothes and undergarments out of the window of her '
                 'room. The next day Esther trades Betsy her bathrobe for a '
                 'skirt and blouse, and makes the trip home to New England. '
                 'Her mother picks her up and immediately tells Esther that '
                 "she did not get accepted into a writing program she'd "
                 'applied to; Esther feels hopeless as she looks at spending '
                 "the rest of the summer in her mother's house. Over the next "
                 'several weeks, Esther is able to do little and slides into '
                 'depression. She continues to wear the blouse and skirt she '
                 'bartered for with Betsy and refuses to bathe or wash her '
                 'hair. She tries to write, but finds she is unable to read, '
                 'write, or sleep. When she asks the family doctor for more '
                 'sleeping pills, after having received a prescription the '
                 'previous week, the doctor refers her to Dr. Gordon, a '
                 'psychiatrist. Esther dislikes Dr. Gordon, a young, '
                 'successful man with what appears to be a perfect family. '
                 "When she isn't cooperative with Dr. Gordon, he suggests to "
                 'her mother that Esther would benefit from elctro-shock '
                 'therapy. Esther undergoes one treatment, a harrowing, '
                 'painful experience that leaves her terrified of the '
                 "procedure. At this point, Esther's reasoning becomes more "
                 'scattered and she becomes obsessed with suicide. After '
                 'several unsuccessful or aborted attempts — slitting wrists, '
                 'hanging, drowning — she wedges herself into the crawlspace '
                 'of her house and takes dozens of sleeping pills. She is '
                 'missing for several days and wakes up in a hospital. Later, '
                 'she is moved to a state mental hospital. With the financial '
                 "help of novelist Philomena Guinea, who funds Esther's "
                 'college scholarship and who was once herself committed to an '
                 'asylum, Esther is moved to a private hospital that is much '
                 'more comfortable and humane than the state hospital. Esther '
                 'meets many of the patients, including Joan, another student '
                 "from Esther's college and a one-time romantic interest of "
                 'Buddy Willard. Esther also meets Dr. Nolan, a female '
                 'psychiatrist who understands Esther far better than Dr. '
                 "Gordon did. Dr. Nolan isn't scandalized when Esther admits "
                 'that she hates her mother, and the doctor also limits all '
                 'visitors to Esther — a gesture Esther is grateful for. Dr. '
                 "Nolan is aware of Esther's terror of electro-shock "
                 'treatments, and later when these treatments are administered '
                 'to Esther, they are a much less harrowing experience, both '
                 "physically and emotionally, because of Dr. Nolan's care. "
                 'Esther continues to have contact with Joan, who she '
                 'interrupts in a lesbian embrace with another patient. Joan '
                 'eventually moves into an apartment, becoming roommates with '
                 'a nurse from the hospital. Esther agrees to come visit Joan '
                 'in the new apartment, although has no intention of following '
                 "through. With Dr. Nolan's help, Esther purchases a "
                 'diaphragm, which frees her from the fear of pregnancy should '
                 'she decide to lose her virginity. That day, she meets a man '
                 'named Irwin, a bookish 26-year-old math professor; they end '
                 "up at Irwin's home, where they make love. Following "
                 'intercourse, Esther finds she is hemorrhaging heavily. She '
                 "asks Irwin to drop her off at Joan's apartment, and Joan "
                 'takes her to the emergency room where she is treated. Joan '
                 'soon moves out of her apartment and returns to the hospital. '
                 "One morning, Joan's psychiatrist comes to see Esther to tell "
                 'her that Joan has not returned from the previous evening; '
                 'Esther is asked if she has any idea where Joan might be. '
                 "Esther doesn't. Later, Joan's body is found in the woods; "
                 'she has hanged herself. Buddy Willard comes to the hospital '
                 'to visit Esther, and asks whether there is something about '
                 'him that drives women crazy, as both Esther and Joan ended '
                 'up in a mental hospital after being with him. The novel ends '
                 'somewhat openly, with Esther stepping into a room in the '
                 'hospital where she will be interviewed to determine whether '
                 'she can leave the hospital and return to college.',

                 'sections, introducing influential characters and events that '

                 'telling us about certain events that happened during the '
                 'fall of 1941. She was only a child then, but she remembers '
                 'that no marigolds bloomed that fall, and she and her friends '
                 'thought it was probably because their friend and playmate, '
                 "Pecola, was having her father's baby. She tells us that "
                 "Pecola's father, Cholly Breedlove, is now dead, the baby is "
                 'dead, and the innocence of the young girls also died that '
                 'fall. We then segue into a lengthy flashback, to Autumn '
                 '1940, a year before the fall when no marigolds bloomed. '
                 'Claudia and her older sister, Frieda, have just started '
                 'school. That autumn, the MacTeers accept Mr. Henry as a '

                 "after Pecola's father burns the family house down. Pecola "

                 'Claudia remembers in particular is the startling onset of '
                 "Pecola's puberty when the eleven-year-old girl unexpectedly "
                 'has her first menstrual period. The second narrator offers '
                 "us her memories about Pecola's family. She describes the "
                 'house where the Breedloves lived (before Cholly burned it '
                 'down), and she points out the antagonistic relationship '
                 "between Pecola's parents. We see Pecola and her brother, "
                 'Sammy, bracing themselves for the ordeal of listening to '
                 'their mother quarreling violently with their drunken father, '
                 'Cholly, as he tries to sleep off the effects of the previous '
                 "night's whiskey. Against a backdrop of grinding poverty, "
                 'with her parents locked in an ugly cycle of hostility and '
                 'violence, Pecola seeks hope in her prayers for beauty, which '
                 'she feels will lead to her being loved. Each night Pecola '
                 'fervently prays for blue eyes, sky-blue eyes, thinking that '
                 'if she looked different — pretty — perhaps everything would '
                 "be better. Maybe everything would be beautiful. Claudia's "
                 'narrative returns with Winter . She remembers the arrival of '
                 'Maureen Peal, a new girl in school, whom Claudia calls "the '
                 'disrupter." Despite Maureen\'s protruding dog-tooth and the '
                 'fact that she was born with an extra finger on each hand '
                 '(removed at birth), Maureen seems to embody everything '
                 'perfect; she has long, beautiful hair, light skin, green '
                 'eyes, and bright, clean, pretty clothes. She is enchanting '
                 'and popular with both the black and white children. Pecola '
                 'is not popular. On the playground, Frieda rescues her from a '
                 'vicious group of boys who are harassing her. Maureen moves '
                 'quickly and stands beside Pecola, and the boys leave. '
                 'Maureen then links arms with Pecola and buys her some ice '
                 'cream. The world seems wonderful until Maureen begins to '
                 "talk about Pecola's father's nakedness. Claudia and Frieda "
                 'quarrel with her, and during the squabble, Claudia swings at '
                 'Maureen but hits Pecola instead. Maureen runs across the '
                 'street and screams back at the three girls, "I am cute! And '
                 'you ugly! Black and ugly . . ." Deeply hurt, Pecola curls '
                 'her shoulders forward in misery. The omniscient narrator now '
                 'describes Geraldine, her son Junior, and her much-loved '
                 'blue-eyed black cat. Neglected by his aloof and '
                 'status-conscious mother, Junior wickedly lures an '
                 'unsuspecting Pecola into his house under the pretense of '
                 'showing her some kittens. Once inside, Junior hurls his '
                 "mother's big black cat in her face. Scratched and terrified, "
                 'Pecola moves toward the door, but Junior blocks her way. She '
                 'is momentarily distracted by the black cat rubbing against '
                 "her. The blue eyes in the cat's black face mesmerize her. "
                 'Junior grabs the cat and begins swinging it in circles. '
                 'Trying to save the cat, Pecola grabs Junior, who falls and '
                 'releases the cat, letting it fly full force against the '
                 'window. Geraldine suddenly arrives home, and Junior '
                 "immediately blames the cat's death on Pecola. Claudia's "
                 'narrative resumes with Spring , and she tells us about '
                 'painful whippings and about her father beating Mr. Henry for '
                 "touching Frieda's tiny breasts. The sisters go to visit "
                 'Pecola, who now lives in a drab downstairs apartment; the '
                 'top floor is home to three prostitutes — Marie ("Miss '
                 'Maginot Line"), China, and Poland. The omniscient narrator '
                 "then tells us about Pauline Breedlove's early life, her "
                 'marriage to Cholly, the births of Pecola and Sammy, and her '
                 "job as a servant for a well-to-do white family. Pauline's "
                 "story is followed by a recounting of Cholly's traumatic "
                 'childhood and adolescence. Abandoned by his mother and '
                 'father, Cholly is raised by a beloved great aunt, Jimmy, who '
                 "dies when Cholly is a teenager. During Cholly's first sexual "
                 'experience, he and the girl, Darlene, are discovered by two '
                 'white men, who mock and humiliate them. Afterward, the pain '
                 'of humiliation, coupled with the fear that Darlene might be '
                 'pregnant, prompt Cholly to leave town and head toward Macon, '
                 'where he hopes to locate his father, Samson Fuller. He finds '
                 'a belligerent wreck of a man who wants nothing to do with '
                 'his son. Cholly eventually shakes off the crushing '
                 'encounter. One day while he is in Kentucky, he meets Pauline '
                 'Williams, marries her, and fathers two children, Sammy and '
                 'Pecola. Years later, on a Saturday afternoon in spring, '
                 'Cholly staggers home. In a drunken, confused state of love '
                 'and lust, he rapes eleven-year-old Pecola and leaves her '
                 'dazed and motionless on the kitchen floor. The omniscient '
                 'narrator continues, introducing the character of Elihue '
                 'Micah Whitcomb, a self-proclaimed psychic and faith healer '
                 'known as Soaphead Church. He is visited by what he calls a '
                 'pitifully unattractive black girl of about twelve or so, '
                 'with a protruding pot belly, who asks him for blue eyes. He '
                 'tricks her into poisoning a sickly old dog, proclaiming the '
                 "dog's sudden death as a sign from God that her wish will be "
                 "granted. Claudia's narrative returns with Summer , and she "
                 'tells us that she and Frieda learned from gossip that Pecola '
                 'was pregnant by her father. She remembers the mix of '
                 'emotions she felt for Pecola — shame, embarrassment, and '
                 'finally sorrow. Alone and pregnant, Pecola talks to her only '
                 'companion — a hallucination. She can no longer go to school, '
                 'so she wraps herself in a cloak of madness that comforts her '
                 'into believing that everyone is jealous of her miraculous, '
                 'new blue eyes. In this final section, Claudia says that she '
                 'remembers seeing Pecola after the baby was born prematurely '
                 "and died. Pecola's brother, Sammy, left town, and Cholly "
                 'died in a workhouse. Pauline is still doing housework for '
                 'white folks, and she and Pecola live in a little brown house '
                 'on the edge of town.',

 'book_title': 'The Brothers Karamazov',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'By his first wife, Fyodor Karamazov sired one son — Dmitri — '
                 'and by his second wife, two sons — Ivan and Alyosha. None of '
                 'the Karamazov, boys, however, was reared in the family home. '
                 'Their mothers dead and their father a drunken fornicator, '
                 'they were parceled out to various relatives. Fyodor could '
                 'not have been more grateful; he could devote all energy and '
                 'time to his notorious orgies. Those were the early years. '
                 'Dmitri comes of age, as the novel opens, and asks his father '
                 'for an inheritance that, he has long been told, his mother '
                 'left him. His request is scoffed at. Old Karamazov feigns '
                 'ignorance of any mythical monies or properties that are '
                 "rightfully Dmitri's. The matter is far from ended, though, "
                 'for Dmitri and his father find themselves instinctive '
                 'enemies, and besides quarreling over the inheritance, they '
                 'vie for Grushenka, a woman of questionable reputation. '
                 'Finally it is suggested that if there is to be peace in the '
                 'Karamazov household, the family must go together to the '
                 "monastery and allow Alyosha's elder, Father Zossima, to "
                 "arbitrate and resolve the quarrels. Ivan, Karamazov's "
                 'intellectual son, accompanies them to the meeting. At the '
                 'monastery, there seems to be little hope for a successful '
                 'reconciliation. Fyodor parades his usual disgusting '
                 'vulgarities, makes a dreadful scene, and when Dmitri arrives '
                 'late, he accuses his son of all sorts of degeneracy. Dmitri '
                 'then retorts that his father has tried to lure Grushenka '
                 'into a liaison by promising her 3,000 rubles, and in the '
                 'midst of their shouting, Father Zossima bows and kisses '
                 "Dmitri's feet. This act ends the interview. All are shocked "
                 'into silence. Later, old Karamazov recovers from his '
                 'astonishment and once again he makes a disgraceful scene in '
                 'the dining room of the Father Superior. He then leaves the '
                 'monastery and commands Alyosha to leave also. It is now that '
                 'Dostoevsky reveals that Karamazov perhaps has fathered '
                 'another son. Years ago, a raggle-taggle moron girl who '
                 'roamed the town was seduced and bore a child; everyone, '
                 'naturally, assumed that the satyr-like Karamazov was '
                 'responsible. The child grew up to be an epileptic and now '
                 'cooks for Karamazov. He is a strange sort, this Smerdyakov, '
                 'and lately his epileptic seizures have become more frequent. '
                 'Curiously, he enjoys talking philosophy with Ivan. The day '
                 'after the explosive scene in the monastery, Alyosha comes to '
                 'visit his father and is stopped midway by Dmitri. The '
                 'emotional, impulsive Karamazov son explains to Alyosha that '
                 'he is sick with grief — that some time ago, he became '
                 'engaged to a girl named Katerina, and has recently borrowed '
                 '3,000 rubles from her to finance an orgy with Grushenka. He '
                 'pleads for Alyosha to speak to Katerina, to break the '
                 'engagement, and to help him find some way to repay the '
                 'squandered money so that he can feel free to elope with '
                 'Grushenka. Alyosha promises to help if he is able. The young '
                 "man reaches his father's house and finds more confusion: "
                 'Smerdyakov is loudly arguing with another servant about '
                 "religion, spouting many of Ivan's ideas. Later, when the "
                 'servants are ordered away, Karamazov taunts Ivan and Alyosha '
                 'about God and immortality, and Ivan answers that he believes '
                 'in neither. Alyosha quietly affirms the existence of both. '
                 'Dmitri then bursts into the room crying for Grushenka and '
                 'when he cannot find her, attacks his father and threatens to '
                 "kill him. Alyosha tends his father's wounds, then goes back "
                 'to the monastery for the night. The next day he goes to see '
                 'Katerina, as he promised Dmitri, and tries to convince her '
                 'that she and Ivan love each other and that she should not '
                 'concern herself with Dmitri and his problems. He is '
                 'unsuccessful. Later that same day, Alyosha comes upon Ivan '
                 'in a restaurant, and they continue the conversation about '
                 "God and immortality that they began at their father's house. "
                 'Ivan says that he cannot accept a world in which God allows '
                 'so many innocent people to suffer and Alyosha says that, '
                 'although Ivan cannot comprehend the logic of God, there is '
                 'One who can comprehend all: Jesus. Ivan then explains, with '
                 'his poem "The Grand Inquisitor," that Jesus is neither a '
                 'ready nor an easy answer-all for his questionings — that He '
                 'placed an intolerable burden on man by giving him total '
                 'freedom of choice. When Alyosha returns to the monastery, he '
                 'finds Father Zossima near death. The elder rallies a bit and '
                 'lives long enough to expound his religious beliefs to his '
                 'small audience, stressing, above all, a life of simplicity, '
                 'a life in which every man shall love all people and all '
                 'things, and shall refrain from condemning others. This is '
                 "Zossima's final wisdom, and when he finishes, he dies. Next "
                 "day many people gather to view the holy man's corpse, for "
                 "popular rumor has whispered for years that upon Zossima's "
                 'death, a miracle would occur. No miracle occurs, however. '
                 'Instead, a foul and putrid odor fills the room, and all of '
                 "the mourners are horrified. Even Alyosha questions God's "
                 'justice and, momentarily yielding to temptation, he flees to '
                 "Grushenka's house. But after he has talked with the girl, he "
                 'discovers that she is not the sinful woman he sought; she is '
                 'remarkably sensitive and quite understanding and '
                 "compassionate. Alyosha's faith is restored and, later, in a "
                 "dream of Jesus' coming to the wedding of Cana, he realizes "
                 'that life is meant to be joyously shared. Now he is '
                 'absolutely certain of his faith in God and in immortality. '
                 'Dmitri has meanwhile been frantically searching for a way to '
                 'raise the money to repay Katerina. He has even gone to a '
                 'neighboring town to try and borrow the sum, but even there '
                 'he fails. Returning, lie discovers that Grushenka is no '
                 'longer at home and panics, sure that she has succumbed to '
                 "Fyodor's rubles. He goes first to his father's house; then, "
                 'after discovering that she is not there, he tries to escape '
                 'but is cornered by an old servant. He strikes him aside, '
                 'leaving him bloody and unconscious, and returns to '
                 "Grushenka's house. He demands to know her whereabouts and at "
                 'last is told that she has gone to join a former lover, one '
                 'who deserted her five years before. Dmitri makes a final '
                 'decision: he will see Grushenka once more, for the last '
                 "time, and then kill himself. He travels to the couple's "
                 'rendezvous, finds Grushenka celebrating with her lover, and '
                 'joins them. There is resentment and arguing, and finally '
                 'Grushenka is convinced that her former lover is a scoundrel '
                 'and that it is Dmitri whom she really loves. The two lovers '
                 'are not to be reunited, however, for the police arrive and '
                 'accuse Dmitri of murdering his father. Both are stunned by '
                 'the circumstantial evidence, for the accusation is weighty. '
                 'Dmitri indeed seems guilty and is indicted to stand trial. '
                 'Alyosha, in the meantime, has made friends with a young '
                 'schoolboy, the son of a man brutally beaten by Dmitri in a '
                 'rage of passion and gradually the youth has proven his '
                 'sincere desire to help the frightened, avenging boy. Now '
                 'that the youngster is dying, Alyosha remains at his bedside, '
                 'where he hopes to help the family and also to reconcile the '
                 'young boy with many of his schoolmates. Ivan, the '
                 'intellectual, has neither the romantic passion of Dmitri nor '
                 'the wide, spiritual interests of Alyosha, and when he learns '
                 "of his father's murder, he broods, then decides to discuss "
                 'his theories with Smerdyakov. He is astonished at the '
                 "bastard servant's open confession that he is responsible for "
                 'the murder. But Smerdyakov is clever; he disavows total '
                 'responsibility and maintains that Ivan gave him the '
                 'intellectual and moral justification for the murder and, '
                 'furthermore, that he actually permitted the act by leaving '
                 'town so that Smerdyakov would be free to accomplish the '
                 'deed. Ivan is slow to accept the argument but after he does, '
                 "he is absolutely convinced of Smerdyakov's logic. The "
                 'transition is disastrous. His newfound guilt makes him a '
                 "madman and the night before Dmitri's trial, he is devoured "
                 'with burning brain fever. That same night, Smerdyakov '
                 "commits suicide. Dmitri's situation becomes increasingly "
                 'perilous. During the trial, the circumstantial evidence is '
                 'presented in so thorough a manner that Dmitri is logically '
                 "convicted as Fyodor's murderer. He has the motive, the "
                 'passion, and was at the scene of the crime. Perhaps the most '
                 'damning bit of evidence, however, is presented by Katerina. '
                 "She shows the court a letter of Dmitri's in which he says "
                 'that he fears he might be driven to murder his father. After '
                 'the conviction, Dmitri agrees to certain plans for his '
                 'escape but says that it will be great torture and suffering '
                 'for him to flee from Mother Russia, from Russian soil, and '
                 'to live in exile. As for Alyosha, his future holds the '
                 'promise of hope and goodness (qualities that were once never '
                 'associated with the Karamazovs), for after young Ilusha dies '
                 'and all his schoolmates attend the funeral, Alyosha gathers '
                 'them together and deeply impresses them with his explanation '
                 'of love and of friendship. Spontaneously, the boys rise and '
                 'cheer Alyosha and his wisdom.',

{'author': 'Mark Twain',
 'book_title': "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court",
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\'s Court is a "framed '
                 'story." That is, the first chapter tells how a tourist in '
                 'England, presumably Mark Twain, meets a stranger who tells '
                 'him part of his story and then gives him a manuscript that '
                 'tells the rest of his strange tale. In the last chapter, the '
                 'tourist has finished reading the manuscript and searches out '
                 'the stranger, only to find him dying and calling out for the '
                 'wife and daughter whom he had lived with in sixth-century '
                 'England. In the first chapter, this stranger (we later learn '
                 'that his name is Hank Morgan, but he is usually referred to '
                 'in the novel as The Boss) tells the tourist that he was '
                 'something of a jack-of-all-trades who had a particular '
                 'aptitude for making and inventing things mechanical. He is '
                 'from Hartford, Connecticut, where he had been head '
                 'superintendent in a munitions factory until, in a fight with '
                 'one of the workers, he was hit in the head with a crowbar. '
                 'When he awakened, he was sitting in the grass under a tree. '
                 'A man in old-fashioned armor took him prisoner, and they '
                 'rode off to what Hank Morgan believed would probably be an '
                 'insane asylum. At this point in the story, this stranger '
                 'begins to feel very sleepy, so he gives the tourist the '
                 'manuscript detailing his adventures, which he has written '
                 'from the journals that he kept. The first chapter of the '
                 'manuscript (the introductory chapter is technically a '
                 'prologue) begins with the knight and Hank Morgan riding '
                 'through a quiet countryside that Morgan does not recognize. '
                 'After a time, they arrive in a small, wretched town and pass '
                 'through the gates of a huge castle; they then enter into a '
                 'great paved court. Trying to find out what asylum this is, '
                 'Hank Morgan talks with a young man who tells him that the '
                 'year is 528 and that the day is June 19; Morgan has been '
                 'captured by Sir Kay the Seneschal, and he will be exhibited '
                 'before the court. Then he will be sent to the dungeons to '
                 'either rot or be ransomed. At the feast around the Round '
                 "Table, Sir Kay's turn to tell of his adventures finally "
                 'arrives, but he is interrupted by Merlin, who tells the '
                 'story of how King Arthur got his sword from the Lady of the '
                 'Lake; he puts the entire crowd to sleep. When Sir Kay does '
                 'tell his story, he exaggerates immensely. Then Arthur '
                 'sentences Morgan to die at noon on the 21st. Morgan is '
                 'stripped of his "enchanted" clothes and is hauled off to the '
                 'dungeons. When Clarence (the boy to whom he had talked) '
                 'comes to visit him, Morgan tells the boy to take a message '
                 'to the court; he says that he is a magician more powerful '
                 'than Merlin. The message has some effect, but Merlin '
                 'ultimately scoffs at the claims of this "magician" because '
                 'the so-called spell that Morgan says that he will cast is '
                 'not specified. By this time, Morgan has remembered that '
                 'there will be an eclipse of the sun at noon on the 21st, so '
                 'Morgan sends Clarence back to tell the court that he will '
                 'blot out the sun — if he must. Shortly thereafter, Morgan is '
                 'hauled out to the courtyard and chained to a stake. A monk '
                 'is praying for him when, suddenly, he stops, and Morgan '
                 'notices that the solar eclipse is just beginning. He '
                 'realizes that when he asked Clarence what day it was, '
                 'Clarence gave him the incorrect day. Thus Morgan puts his '
                 'knowledge of the eclipse to good use, thereby gaining his '
                 'freedom and a position as "perpetual minister and executive" '
                 'to the king, as well as liberal funding, if he will "let" '
                 'the sun shine again. He keeps the king and the knights in '
                 'suspense for a time, ostensibly to make sure that the king '
                 'meant what he said; then, when he notices that the eclipse '
                 'is total, he announces that his spell will now begin to pass '
                 'away. This "miracle" makes Morgan a man of great interest to '
                 'the people of the kingdom, and when Merlin begins spreading '
                 "rumors about him, Morgan blows up Merlin's tower, using "
                 'explosives which he and Clarence have made. This "miracle" '
                 "solidifies Morgan's position in the country. At one of the "
                 'frequent tournaments held in Camelot, Sir Dinadan (who tells '
                 'many bad jokes) is being drubbed by Sir Gareth, and The Boss '
                 '(as Morgan is now called) says that he hopes that he (Sir '
                 'Dinadan) dies. By the time these ambiguous words are '
                 'uttered, however, Sir Gareth has crashed into Sir Sagramor '
                 "le Desirous, and Sir Sagramor thinks that Morgan's "
                 'derogatory wish was meant for him. Sagramor therefore '
                 'challenges Morgan, The Boss, to a bout after he, Sagramor, '
                 'returns from questing after the Holy Grail. The king and '
                 'others urge The Boss to also undertake a quest so that he '
                 'will be more worthy of taking on Sir Sagramor. Morgan puts '
                 'off this journey for some time, though, so that he can make '
                 'some changes in the kingdom — such changes as providing some '
                 'schools, factories, military academies, telephones, and '
                 'telegraph lines; all these changes are done quietly, of '
                 'course, so that they will not be too noticeable immediately. '
                 'Finally, Morgan can put off his quest no longer. The king '
                 'decides that Morgan will accompany the Demoiselle Alisande '
                 'la Carteloise to free her mistress and forty-four princesses '
                 'held captive by three giants with one eye each. Along the '
                 'way, Morgan, The Boss, discovers many things; first, he '
                 'learns that armor is very uncomfortable to ride in and also '
                 'to sleep in. Then he and the Demoiselle have a meal with '
                 'several freemen, one of whom is willing to think about '
                 'change; as a result, he is sent back to Camelot for Clarence '
                 'to put into training. A little later, The Boss terrifies six '
                 'armed knights by stoking up a head of smoke with his pipe as '
                 'they charge at him; the knights halt, amazed, and are '
                 'willing to surrender. That evening, the evening of the '
                 'second day out from Camelot, they come upon the castle ruled '
                 'by Morgan le Fay. Although the wicked le Fay has a quick '
                 'temper and is willing to kill anyone who crosses her even '
                 'slightly, she becomes very deferential when she learns that '
                 'her visitor is The Boss. She allows him his way even after '
                 'he frees a man accused of killing a deer on the royal '
                 'preserve and even though he frees nearly all of the '
                 'prisoners in her dungeons. She casually stabs for a young '
                 'boy, but she refrains from throwing his grandmother, who '
                 'curses her for that deed, into the dungeons. Several days '
                 'later, Sandy (the name which Morgan has given his traveling '
                 'companion) informs The Boss that they are coming upon an '
                 "ogres' castle. The Boss, however, can see only a pigsty "
                 'filled with pigs, but Sandy assures him that it is a castle '
                 'and that those are princesses (and not pigs) who must be '
                 'freed. Rather than argue with her, The Boss agrees that this '
                 'castle must surely be enchanted — but enchanted for his eyes '
                 'only. Thus, he rides down and buys the pigs from the '
                 'swineherds. He and Sandy then drive the pigs to a nearby '
                 'castle, where the "princesses" will wait to be reclaimed by '
                 'their kin or friends. When The Boss and Sandy meet a band of '
                 'pilgrims heading toward the Valley of Holiness, they also '
                 'decide to travel in that direction. On the way, they meet '
                 'one of The Boss\'s "sign board knights," knights who are '
                 'advertising various products which The Boss wants to '
                 'introduce into England. But it is not long before they learn '
                 'that there is a problem in the Valley of Holiness that '
                 "requires one of the Boss's spells to set right, so he sends "
                 'a knight back to Camelot with a note to Clarence for '
                 'supplies and helpers. The problem in the Valley of Holiness '
                 'is that the holy well, believed to be the product of a '
                 'miracle in an earlier day, has gone dry. The Boss examines '
                 'it and finds that a section of the wall has been broken. '
                 'While he waits for his supplies and aides to arrive from '
                 'Camelot, he insists that professional courtesy requires him '
                 'to wait until Merlin gives up before he takes over. Merlin '
                 'does finally admit that he has failed to fill the well, but '
                 "he gives up just as two of The Boss's helpers arrive; when "
                 "they do, they quickly repair the hole in the well's wall, "
                 'and then they prepare to make a spectacle of the restoration '
                 'of water to the well. The "miracle," of course, is a '
                 "success, and The Boss's reputation is reaffirmed. A short "
                 'time later, however, another magician arrives, and for the '
                 "moment, he eclipses The Boss's reputation. All is not lost, "
                 'however. Using a telephone that has just been installed in '
                 'one of the abandoned caves in the Valley, The Boss predicts '
                 'that the king and his retinue will be in the Valley of '
                 'Holiness in two days; the other magician insists that the '
                 'king will be traveling in the other direction. When the king '
                 'does arrive on time, the other magician is discredited. '
                 'While the king is there, he dispenses justice, he oversees '
                 'the choosing of officers for the standing army (a process '
                 'that The Boss is unhappy with), and he allows those who are '
                 'ill to attempt to heal themselves by touching him. After '
                 'this business is taken care of, The Boss and the king set '
                 'out to travel into the countryside in disguise. The Boss '
                 'wants to find out, firsthand, what the conditions of the '
                 'country are, and the king thinks that it might be a lark to '
                 'go along. Thus, the two set out. The Boss and the king have '
                 'a number of problems on their journey because the king '
                 'simply will not, or cannot, act like a peasant; indeed, The '
                 'Boss manages to save them from being killed several times, '
                 'once by using a dynamite bomb to blow up a group of charging '
                 'knights. During one incident, they help a woman who is dying '
                 'of smallpox, leaving just before her sons, who had been '
                 'imprisoned by the local lord, escape and arrive home. As The '
                 'Boss and the king move through the night, they see the glow '
                 'of a fire in the distance, and they discover the corpses of '
                 'a number of men who have been hanged. Near morning, they '
                 'come to a hut, and they finally convince the woman who '
                 'greets them to give them some hospitality. After they have '
                 'slept, she feeds them, and they learn that the lord of that '
                 'area has been killed and that all the freemen in the '
                 'neighborhood have been out all night looking for whoever is '
                 'responsible for the murder. The Boss notices that his host '
                 'and hostess are terribly nervous, and he guesses that they '
                 'are probably related to the boys who are responsible for the '
                 "lord's death. Therefore, he goes out with his host, Marco, "
                 'and they agree that they will say nothing about key suspects '
                 'who escaped. Instead, they walk through the village talking '
                 'to people. The Boss invites a number of them to dinner that '
                 'Sunday, and he insists on paying for everything; thus a '
                 "sumptuous spread is prepared at the store. The Boss's "
                 'purpose in gathering these people for a meal is to find out '
                 'what they think about wages and about the relationship '
                 'between wages and purchasing power; he wants to convince '
                 'them that his way of thinking is better than theirs, but all '
                 'he manages to do is make them suspicious of him. Then, '
                 'before he can cover up his error and ease their suspicions, '
                 'the king begins talking about agricultural matters in such a '
                 'way that makes these people think that he is mad. As a '
                 'result, the men set upon the king and The Boss. Although the '
                 'king and The Boss are winning the fight, they notice that '
                 'their hosts have left. Suspecting that they have gone for '
                 'help to aid their neighbors, the king and The Boss flee. '
                 'They are finally captured, however, but before these '
                 'villagers can beat them, as they intend to do, the king and '
                 'The Boss are rescued by an earl named Grip. Although Grip '
                 'feeds them, gives them a room for the night, and lends them '
                 'horses to ride to the next town, once they are there, he has '
                 'them bound and sold as slaves. They are then driven to '
                 'London, along with a number of other slaves. Along the way, '
                 'they see several instances of the cruelty of the laws and '
                 'the difficulties of the life of the common people. After a '
                 'time, The Boss manages to steal a metal clasp with a long '
                 'pin from a prospective slave buyer; he uses this as a lock '
                 'pick, and he is able to free himself. Before he can escape, '
                 'however, the slave master comes in. The Boss tries to catch '
                 'him, but he scuffles with the wrong man, and both of them '
                 'are arrested. In the morning, in court, The Boss tells the '
                 'judge a story that effects his immediate release, and he '
                 'uses a telephone to call Clarence in Camelot so that knights '
                 'can be sent to the rescue. In the meantime, he learns that '
                 'the slaves had killed the slave-master in the night and that '
                 'all of them are to be hanged. He tries to make some contacts '
                 'with people he knows, but in doing so, he is captured and '
                 'put in with the other slaves; the jailer tells him that they '
                 'are all to be hanged in the middle of the afternoon. At a '
                 'climactic moment when three of the slaves have been hanged, '
                 'and the blindfold has been put on the king, suddenly five '
                 "hundred of Camelot's finest knights ride up on bicycles. "
                 'They take charge of the situation and rescue the king and '
                 'The Boss. Just after they return to Camelot, The Boss learns '
                 'that he must enter the tournament lists and must joust '
                 'against Sir Sagramor. Instead of conventional weapons, '
                 'however, The Boss uses a lasso and ropes Sir Sagramor and '
                 'yanks several other knights off their horses. After Merlin '
                 'steals the rope, Sir Sagramor challenges The Boss again; '
                 'this time, The Boss uses a revolver which he has made and '
                 'shoots him. When one of the other knights challenges him, '
                 'The Boss challenges all of them together, and he shoots nine '
                 'of them before the rest turn and flee. After this, The Boss '
                 'has his own way for a time, and he makes many changes in '
                 'England, revealing some of the earlier changes which he '
                 'quietly accomplished. He also marries Sandy, and they have a '
                 'child whom Sandy names Hello-Central. When Hello-Central '
                 'falls ill, The Boss spends a great deal of time with her '
                 'and, on the advice of doctors, he takes her to the seaside. '
                 'She falls ill again while they are visiting a kingdom on the '
                 'French coast. About a month later, after she is fully '
                 'recovered, The Boss goes to England to see what has happened '
                 'to the boat which they had sent to bring them supplies; they '
                 'are worried, for it should have returned at least three '
                 'weeks earlier. Once in England, The Boss learns that all of '
                 'the changes which he had made have now fallen under an '
                 'Interdict of the Catholic Church. The Boss then makes his '
                 'way to Camelot. He and Clarence make plans for a final '
                 'battle against most of England, with only fifty-two of the '
                 "people whom they trained as helpers. Working from Merlin's "
                 'cave, they kill twenty-five thousand knights, using electric '
                 'fencing, Gatling guns, and an ingeniously diverted stream. '
                 'When The Boss goes out to see if they can give aid to any of '
                 'those who still survive, one of the wounded enemies stabs '
                 'him. Luckily, however, the wound is only slight. Yet all is '
                 'far from being peaceful yet, for Merlin enters the cave in '
                 'the guise of an old woman and casts a spell on The Boss that '
                 'makes him sleep for thirteen hundred years. Thus the novel '
                 "ends with the tourist's reaching The Boss's room just as The "
                 'Boss dies, calling for Sandy and Hello-Central.',

{'author': 'François Voltaire',
 'book_title': 'Candide',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Candide begins in the German town of Westphalia, where '
                 'Candide, a young man, lives in the castle of Baron of '
                 'Thunder-ten-tronckh. A noted philosopher, Doctor Pangloss, '
                 'tutors the baron on philosophical optimism, the idea that '
                 '"all is for the best . . . in this best of all worlds." '
                 'Candide, a simple man, first accepts this philosophy, but as '
                 'he experiences the horrors of war, poverty, the '
                 'maliciousness of man, and the hypocrisy of the church, he '
                 "begins to doubt the voracity of Pangloss's theory. Thus, "
                 "philosophical optimism is the focus of Votaire's satire; "
                 'anti-war and anti-church refrains also run throughout the '
                 'novel. In the first chapter, Doctor Pangloss is having an '
                 "illicit affair with Paquette, a chambermaid. The baron's "
                 'beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, witnesses the affair and '
                 'decides to try something similar with Candide. When the '
                 'baron catches them, Candide is kicked out of the castle. '
                 'Hungry and cold, Candide makes his way to a neighboring '
                 'town, where he is aided by two soldiers. He is pressed into '
                 'service and endures beatings at the hands of his superiors. '
                 'He runs away, coming across war-torn villages in the process '
                 'and witnessing the horrors of war firsthand. Candide makes '
                 'his way to Christian Holland, where he hopes to find charity '
                 'but finds hardhearted people, save one, an Anabaptist, who '
                 'shows Candide kindness and generosity. Candide then meets a '
                 'beggar who is suffering from a disfiguring disease and soon '
                 'discovers that the beggar is Doctor Pangloss. Pangloss '
                 'recounts his recent experiences, including the death of the '
                 'baron and his family at the hands of soldiers. In spite of '
                 "Pangloss's condition and the horrors around him, the good "
                 'doctor still believes in philosophical optimism. The '
                 'Anabaptist sees to it that Pangloss is cured, and then takes '
                 'him and Candide to Lisbon via ship. When a storm blows up, '
                 'the Anabaptist is killed trying to save a sailor; the ship '
                 'later breaks up, leaving Candide, Pangloss, and the rescued '
                 'sailor as the only survivors. No sooner do they land on the '
                 'Lisbon shore than an earthquake shakes the city; in '
                 'response, church leaders decide to show an auto-da-fé, or '
                 'act of faith, which includes a sacrifice of people. Pangloss '
                 'is hanged, but Candide survives, helped by an old woman. The '
                 'old woman cleans and feeds Candide, and then takes him to '
                 "Cunégonde, who survived the brutal attack on the baron's "
                 'family. She is living with two powerful men who try to share '
                 'her affections, and she was responsible for saving Candide '
                 "from the killings during the auto-da-fé. Cunégonde's two men "
                 'come upon the young lovers, and Candide kills them both. '
                 'Frightened, Candide, Cunégonde, and the old woman escape to '
                 'a port city, where a military vessel is loading up for a '
                 "mission in Paraguay. Candide's military training impresses "
                 'the Spanish general, and Candide is made a captain with '
                 'command of an infantry. With Cunégonde and the old woman, '
                 'Candide sails for South America. During the voyage, the old '
                 'woman tells her story, which is horrific — she has suffered '
                 'far more than anyone else in the party. Candide begins to '
                 "seriously question Pangloss's theory of philosophical "
                 'optimism. In Buenos Aires, they meet the governor, Don '
                 'Fernando, who takes an interest in Cunégonde and asks for '
                 'her hand in marriage. Candide is heartbroken, but he cannot '
                 'stay and fight for Cunégonde, because he must flee from '
                 'police officers who traced Candide to the region. Aided by '
                 'Cacambo, a valet, Candide escapes and soon meets the '
                 'Reverend Father Commander, leader of a Jesuit army in '
                 "Paraguay. The commander turns out to be Cunégonde's brother, "
                 'who was left for dead when his mother and father were killed '
                 'in Westphalia. The two catch up until Candide reveals that '
                 'he is love with Cunégonde and hopes to someday marry her; '
                 "the baron's son is so enraged by this notion that a fight "
                 'ensues, and Candide kills the man. Again, Candide flees with '
                 'Cacambo and, before long, the two face the Oreillons, who at '
                 'first nearly kill Candide but soon treat him hospitably. '
                 'Upon leaving their company, Candide and Cacambo come to '
                 'Eldorado, a country filled with gold and jewels for which '
                 "the citizens have no use, because everyone's needs are met "
                 'by the government. Eldorado also has no court rooms or '
                 'prisons, because citizens treat each other fairly and do not '
                 'break laws. The citizens of Eldorado believe in God but '
                 'never pray in supplication — they only give thanks because '
                 'they have all they need. Eager to find Cunégonde, Candide '
                 'and Cacambo leave Eldorado with a team of red sheep loaded '
                 'with gold, jewels, and other supplies. When they reach '
                 'Surinam, the two traveling companions split up, with Cacambo '
                 'heading in secret to Buenos Aires to buy the release of '
                 'Cunégonde, and Candide heading to Venice, where he will not '
                 "be sought by the police. Candide is victimized by a ship's "
                 'captain, a ruthless man named Mynheer Vanderdendur, and the '
                 'judge from whom Candide seeks redress. Dejected, Candide '
                 'advertises a contest for the most unfortunate man he can '
                 'find; an elderly scholar named Martin wins the contest and '
                 "becomes Candide's new traveling partner. The two head to "
                 'France, en route to Venice. In Paris, Candide becomes ill '
                 'and is attended by a variety of people, all of whom want a '
                 'piece of his fortune. He recovers, but is tricked by an '
                 'actress into giving away much of his fortune and is '
                 'eventually arrested by the police, who are suspicious of all '
                 'strangers. From there, Candide and Martin are sent to '
                 'England, where they witness more violence, and then finally '
                 'reach Venice. Through various discussions and wagers with '
                 'Martin, as well as meetings with a variety of people, '
                 'Candide comes to lose faith in philosophical optimism. Soon, '
                 'Candide finds Cacambo, now a slave, who informs Candide that '
                 'Cunégonde is in Constantinople, working as a servant. '

 'book_title': 'Catch-22',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "Captain John Yossarian, the novel's protagonist, is a "
                 'bombardier in the 256th Squadron of the Army Air Forces '
                 'during World War II, stationed on Pianosa, a fictionalized '
                 'island in the Mediterranean between mainland Italy and '
                 "Corsica. The squadron's assignment is to bomb enemy "
                 'positions in Italy and eastern France. It is the summer of '
                 '1944, but events of the novel are not told in chronological '
                 'order; sometimes time changes without warning. Most of the '
                 'action takes place from spring through December of 1944, but '
                 'there are flashbacks to 1942, when Yossarian was in basic '
                 'training at Lowery Field in Colorado, and to 1943 when he '
                 'was in cadet training at Santa Ana, California. The '
                 'satirical novel is episodic and relies on character as much '
                 'as it does on plot or theme. We meet several key characters '
                 'in the opening chapters. When the novel opens, Yossarian is '
                 'in the base hospital, on Pianosa, faking a liver ailment. He '
                 'has learned that the hospital can be a peaceful refuge and '
                 'that liver ailments are difficult to diagnose. When able, '
                 "hospitalized officers censor enlisted men's letters home; an "
                 "early indication of Yossarian's character is the creative "
                 'way he approaches this task, even altering one letter to '
                 "resemble a love note and signing Chaplain Tappman's name. "
                 "Others in Yossarian's ward include Dunbar, who thinks he can "
                 'live longer by pursuing boring tasks and making time pass '
                 'slowly, and the "soldier in white," an enigmatic figure '
                 'smuggled into the ward in the middle of the night and '
                 'encased from head to toe in gauze and plaster. Yossarian is '
                 'so annoyed by a bigoted Texan that he soon returns to his '
                 'regular quarters where his tent mate, Orr, uses outstanding '
                 'mechanical talents to improve living conditions. Other '
                 'squadron members include McWatt, a pilot who enjoys buzzing '
                 "(flying low over) Yossarian's tent and the beach bathers; "
                 'Nately, who is in love with a prostitute in Rome; Doc '
                 'Daneeka, a friendly but ineffectual flight surgeon who '
                 'explains the meaning of "Catch-22" (Chapter 5); and Colonel '
                 'Cathcart, who yearns to be a general so he tries to look '
                 'like a strong leader by raising the number of missions '
                 'required of the men to complete a tour of duty. The early '
                 'chapters satirize the military and political establishment, '
                 'specifically through distortions of logic and reality. '
                 'Earlier in the summer, when an apparently hazardous raid on '
                 'Bologna seems imminent, for example, Yossarian postpones the '
                 'mission by simply moving a line on a map, indicating that '
                 'the Americans and other Allies have already captured the '
                 'city. Although war and death are always in the background, '
                 'the tone of the first third of the novel is ironic and '
                 'absurdly light-hearted. The tone changes with flashbacks to '
                 'raids on Ferrara, Bologna, and Avignon. At Ferrara, in the '
                 'spring of 1944, Yossarian is an inexperienced bombardier '
                 'eager to succeed in the mission so it will not be repeated. '
                 'Having failed to release his bombs on the first run, '
                 'Yossarian directs his flight to take a second pass so that '
                 'he can hit the target, a bridge that the squadron has tried '
                 'in vain to destroy for a week. The tactic works, but a young '
                 'airman named Kraft is killed. Although Yossarian is promoted '
                 'to Captain and awarded a medal, the death haunts him. When '
                 'the squadron eventually must bomb Bologna a second time, in '
                 'late June 1944, the flak (ground fire at the aircraft) is '
                 "exceptionally intense. Heller's description of the raid "
                 '(Chapter 15) is one of the most vivid passages in the novel. '
                 'By now, Yossarian has had all he wants of war. His tent '
                 'mate, Orr, is shot down and presumed lost at sea. The '
                 'mission over Avignon, in July, is personally even more '
                 'traumatic for Yossarian as his plane is badly hit and a '
                 'gunner named Snowden severely wounded. Heller repeatedly '
                 'refers to the event throughout the novel, playing it like a '
                 'recurring theme in a symphony, the reader allowed to learn a '
                 'little more of the horror as the story progresses. (The '
                 "novel's first scene occurs shortly after the raid on "
                 'Avignon.) Leaves of absence in Rome allow respite for the '
                 'men and a change of tone for the reader. Here the men '
                 'initially find romance, parties, frolic, and joy. '
                 "Yossarian's brief affair with a young woman named Luciana is "
                 'one of the more poignant interludes, although we soon are '
                 "reminded that Yossarian's relations with women are troubled "
                 'at best. Nately argues patriotism with a 107-year-old cynic '
                 "at a bordello, one of the novel's several debates concerning "
                 'values. But Rome, too, is altered by the war, as Yossarian '
                 'learns in the closing chapters. As the story progresses, '
                 "amusing antics turn grim. The squadron's mess (dining hall) "
                 'officer is an entrepreneurial whiz named Milo Minderbinder, '
                 'whose capitalistic expertise is satirically entertaining '
                 'until it turns deadly. Using squadron funds to purchase '
                 'black-market products, Milo builds an enormous syndicate '
                 'dealing in everything from fresh eggs to prostitutes. He '
                 'eventually contracts with both sides in the conduct of the '
                 'war and goes so far as to arrange an air raid on his own '
                 "base for profit. McWatt's buzzing of the beach is a "
                 'practical joke until one day when he slices Kid Sampson in '
                 "two in a macabre accident. Nately's devotion to his "
                 "prostitute seems like an innocent young man's harmless crush "
                 'until he insists on flying extra missions so that he can '
                 "stay near her — and is killed the next time out. Nately's "
                 'death serves as a transition to the end of the novel. When '
                 "Yossarian reports the tragedy to the young man's "
                 'prostitute-fiancée in Rome, she directs all her frustration '
                 'and anger toward Yossarian, attacking him repeatedly, even '
                 'after he returns to Pianosa. Yossarian has refused to fly '
                 'further missions. Colonels Cathcart and Korn call him in for '
                 'a conference in which they offer Yossarian a "deal": He can '
                 'return home if only he will speak well of the commanding '
                 'officers and turn his back on the men of the squadron. '
                 'Yossarian agrees. Leaving the office, he is again assaulted '
                 "by Nately's fiancée and seriously wounded. In the hospital, "
                 'Yossarian reflects on all his friends who have died or '
                 'disappeared during the year. He decides to renege on the '
                 'agreement even though he is thus eligible for court-martial. '
                 "Yossarian's plan is to rescue Nately's kid sister from the "
                 'streets of Rome and flee to Sweden where his buddy Orr has '
                 'turned up after cleverly using his plane crash as a means of '
                 'escape. Yossarian hopes to find himself by losing himself, '
                 'to seek a separate peace, to run toward life by escaping the '
                 'madness of war.',

{'author': 'Fyodor Dostoevsky',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Raskolnikov, an impoverished student, conceives of himself '
                 'as being an extraordinary young man and then formulates a '
                 'theory whereby the extraordinary men of the world have a '
                 'right to commit any crime if they have something of worth to '
                 'offer humanity. To prove his theory, he murders an old, '
                 'despicable pawnbroker and her half-sister who happened to '
                 'come upon him suddenly. Immediately after the crime, he '
                 'becomes ill and lies in his room semi-conscious for several '

                 "visit from Luzhin, who is engaged to Raskolnikov's sister, "
                 'Dunya. Raskolnikov insults Luzhin and sends him away because '
                 "he resents Luzhin's domineering attitude toward Dunya. As "
                 'soon as he can be about again, Raskolnikov goes out and '
                 'reads about the crime in all the newspapers of the last few '
                 'days. He meets an official from the police station and '
                 'almost confesses the crime. He does go far enough in his '
                 'ranting that the official becomes suspicious. Later, he '
                 'witnesses the death of Marmeladov, a minor government '
                 'official, who is struck by a carriage as he staggers across '
                 'the street in a drunken stupor. Raskolnikov assists the man '
                 'and leaves all his money to the destitute widow. When he '
                 'returns to his room, he finds his mother and sister who have '
                 'just arrived to prepare for the wedding with Luzhin. He '
                 'denounces Luzhin and refuses to allow his sister to marry '
                 'such a mean and nasty man. About the same time, '
                 "Svidrigailov, Dunya's former employer, arrives in town and "
                 'looks up Raskolnikov and asks for a meeting with Dunya. '
                 'Previously Svidrigailov had attempted to seduce Dunya and '
                 'when Raskolnikov had heard of it, he naturally formed a '
                 'violent dislike for the man. Raskolnikov hears that the '
                 'police inspector, Porfiry, is interviewing all people who '
                 'had ever had any business with the old pawnbroker. '
                 'Therefore, he goes for an interview and leaves thinking that '
                 'the police suspect him. Since he had met Sonya Marmeladov, '
                 'the daughter of the dead man that he had helped, he goes to '
                 'her and asks her to read to him from the Bible the story of '
                 'Lazarus. He feels great sympathy with Sonya who had been '
                 'forced into prostitution in order to support her family '
                 'while her father drank constantly. In her suffering, she '
                 'becomes a universal symbol for Raskolnikov. He promises to '
                 'tell her who murdered the old pawnbroker and her sister who '
                 "was a friend of Sonya's. After another interview with "
                 'Porfiry, Raskolnikov determines to confess to Sonya. He '
                 'returns to her and during the confession, Svidrigailov is '
                 'listening through the adjoining door. He uses this '
                 'information to try to force Dunya to sleep with him. She '
                 'refuses and he kills himself later in the night. Porfiry '
                 'informs Raskolnikov that he knows who murdered the '
                 'pawnbroker. After talking with Sonya, Raskolnikov fully '
                 'confesses to the murder and is sentenced to eight years in a '
                 'Siberian prison. Sonya follows him, and with her help, '

 'summary_text': 'The curtain rises to show the interior of a theater. Several '
                 'spectators are present, waiting for the play to begin, and '
                 'their conversation informs us (erroneously) that this is the '
                 "famous theater in which Corneille's Le Cid was introduced. "
                 "The play tonight is Baro's Clorise , and the leading actor "
                 'is Montfleury. The curtain rises to show the interior of a '
                 'theater. Several spectators are present, waiting for the '
                 'play to begin, and their conversation informs us '
                 '(erroneously) that this is the famous theater in which '
                 "Corneille's Le Cid was introduced. The play tonight is "
                 "Baro's Clorise , and the leading actor is Montfleury. "
                 'Ragueneau and Le Bret enter, and Lignière calls attention to '
                 'the fashionable people who are present. They wonder where '
                 'Cyrano is, since he has forbidden Montfleury to act on the '
                 'stage. When Roxane enters, Christian points her out to Le '
                 'Bret as the woman with whom he is in love, even though he '
                 'does not know her name and has never talked to her. Lignière '
                 'says that De Guiche is also interested in Roxane, and though '
                 'she is resisting him, he is a very powerful and vindictive '
                 'man. He is also married. Before the play-within-a-play '
                 'begins, Christian goes to warn Lignière (who has left the '
                 'theater) that his latest poem has offended a highly placed '
                 "person who has stationed a hundred men near Lignière's "
                 'street to ambush and murder him. The curtain rises and '
                 "Montfleury enters on stage. As he begins to speak, Cyrano's "
                 'voice interrupts and tells him to leave the stage. Cyrano '
                 'offers to fight anyone who wishes to defend Montfleury, but '
                 'there are no volunteers. When the manager of the theater '
                 'asks Cyrano if he is also going to force him to refund the '
                 'money of the patrons, Cyrano tosses a bag of gold to the '
                 'stage, and the manager is happy. An affected gentleman who '
                 'wishes to insult Cyrano says, "Your nose is very large." '
                 'Cyrano describes to him what a number of different types of '
                 'people might have said about his nose. Then he says that '
                 'while they duel, he will compose a ballade and thrust on the '
                 'last line. He proceeds to do just that. When almost all the '
                 'spectators have left the theater, Cyrano confesses to Le '
                 'Bret that he is in love with his cousin, Roxane. Then '
                 "Roxane's duenna, or female chaperon, comes in and makes an "
                 'appointment with Cyrano for the next day. He is ecstatic, '
                 "and when he learns of Lignière's plight, he happily goes off "
                 'to fight the one hundred men lying in wait for the poet. The '
                 "next morning, Cyrano waits for Roxane in Ragueneau's pastry "
                 'shop. He writes a letter, thinking that he may simply hand '
                 'it to her when she arrives and leave without waiting for her '
                 'answer. When she comes, she confesses that she is in love '
                 'with Christian. Cyrano, broken-hearted though he is, '
                 'promises that he will look after Christian for her. All of '
                 'Paris is talking of his exploit of the previous night in '
                 'routing the one hundred men sent to murder Lignière. De '
                 "Guiche comes and offers to be Cyrano's patron, but Cyrano "
                 'refuses. Christian joins the Cadets of Gascogne, the famed '
                 'Gascony Guards, and he and Cyrano become friends. He '
                 'confesses to Cyrano that he loves Roxane, but that he is '
                 'afraid that he cannot express himself well enough to win her '
                 'love. Cyrano gives him the letter that he himself had '
                 'written to Roxane and tells him to send it to her in his own '
                 'name. This is the beginning of the deception. Cyrano writes '
                 'beautiful letters and makes up impassioned speeches that '
                 "Christian memorizes. Roxane falls in love with Christian's "
                 'borrowed eloquence. At last, however, Christian tires of his '
                 "role as Cyrano's mouthpiece. The company is leaving for the "
                 'siege of Arras, and before he goes, he wants to woo Roxane '
                 'with his own words. But he has underestimated the strength '
                 'of her attachment to beautiful language and gets nowhere '
                 'with her. Cyrano saves the day for him by hiding under the '
                 'balcony where Roxane stands and whispering words that '
                 "Christian repeats. Soon, however, Cyrano's enthusiasm makes "
                 'this unbearable and he speaks aloud — but Roxane does not '
                 'know that it is he and not Christian who is speaking. A monk '
                 'brings a letter from De Guiche to Roxane, saying that he is '
                 'sending the regiment on ahead, but that he is remaining '
                 'behind for one night in the expectation of meeting Roxane '
                 'secretly. Roxane pretends that the letter directs the monk '
                 'to marry her to Christian immediately, which he does while '
                 'Cyrano detains De Guiche. The marriage is not consummated, '
                 'however, because the Guards leave for the front, on the '
                 'orders of De Guiche, to fight at the siege of Arras. During '
                 'the siege, Cyrano finds a way through the lines and risks '
                 'his life to get letters to Roxane, purportedly from '
                 'Christian. Much to the surprise of everyone, Roxane appears, '
                 "bringing food and news, which makes Cyrano's hopes soar. She "
                 'has come, she says, to confess that at first she loved '
                 'Christian for his beauty, but that now, because of his '
                 'letters, she has fallen in love with his spirit and his '
                 'wonderful mind. This is a much deeper and truer love, and '
                 'she is ashamed that she has been so shallow. Christian is an '
                 'honorable man and he wants Cyrano to tell Roxane the truth. '
                 "Just as Cyrano is about to do so, Christian's body is "
                 'carried in; he has been killed by the first shot fired in '
                 'the battle. Nearly 15 years elapse, and we find the mourning '
                 "Roxane in a convent. She has always carried Christian's last "
                 'letter next to her heart. Cyrano comes to her each week and '
                 "gives her a witty resume of the week's gossip. Today, "
                 "however, he is late. One of Cyrano's enemies has managed to "
                 "injure him by having a lackey drop a heavy log on Cyrano's "
                 'head as he passed beneath a window. Cyrano is mortally '
                 'wounded, but still comes just at sunset, as always, to give '
                 'Roxane her news of the outside world. He sits in his usual '
                 "chair and begins, but then asks to read Christian's last "
                 'letter. Roxane gives it to him. As he reads, she realizes '
                 'that it is too dark for him to see the words and that this '
                 'was the voice she had heard under her balcony on her wedding '
                 'night. As Cyrano dies, Roxane says that she has loved only '
                 'once, but has lost her love twice.',

 'book_title': 'The Call of the Wild',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Buck, a huge, four-year-old half-Saint Bernard and '
                 'half-Scottish shepherd dog, is living a life of civilized '
                 "ease in California's Santa Clara Valley in the home of Judge "
                 'Miller. It seems to be the best of all possible worlds, for '
                 'Buck is the most prized animal that the Judge owns. Around '
                 'this time, however, gold is discovered in the great North, '
                 'and large dogs suddenly become tremendously valuable because '
                 'these types of dogs are needed to haul the heavy sleds '
                 'through the deep snow fields. Tragically, for Buck, one of '
                 "the Judge's servants (an addictive gambler) steals Buck and "
                 'sells him to a ring of thieves who are making a great deal '
                 'of money by buying and selling dogs to northern traders. '
                 "Buck's spirit, however, does not adapt as easily as do some "
                 'of the other docile big dogs. Buck cannot tolerate being '
                 'tied up and beaten; he fights against his cruel new master, '
                 'but all of his efforts to escape are futile. Thus, Buck '
                 'learns the new concept of "master," even though he learns it '
                 'reluctantly: a man with a club is a master and must, at all '
                 'costs, be obeyed. After days of travel on both train and '
                 'boat, Buck discovers that he is in the primitive North, and '
                 'there he rapidly learns to conform to the laws of the '
                 'primitive new world. For example, he encounters such '
                 'problems as how to work as a member of a dog team pulling a '
                 'sled, how to burrow into a hole in the snow in which to '
                 'sleep, how to survive perpetual hunger pains, and how to '
                 'rely on his native intelligence and his animal instincts. '
                 'Buck also soon learns that the dominant primordial bestial '
                 'instinct is very strong in him, and he learns just as '
                 'quickly that when he is attacked, he must take the offensive '
                 'immediately in order to survive; as a result of this type of '
                 'living adjustment, Buck also learns that he has to live a '
                 'life of almost continual alertness, as well as in almost '
                 'continual pain and discomfort. Yet Buck has one advantage: '
                 'his size makes him fearful to the other dogs. Still, '
                 'however, all is far from pleasant, for even though Buck can '
                 'defend himself quite well and is ever-ready to scrap with '
                 'another dog, he has a secret that he must keep to himself: '
                 'Because Buck has arrived so recently from civilization, the '
                 'craggy ice and snow of the North tear at his paws and make '
                 'his work extremely painful. After being in constant hunger '
                 "for many days, Buck's old instinct to kill and eat raw meat "
                 'and warm blood is rekindled within him. About this same '
                 'time, Buck is constantly pitted against another powerful '
                 'dog, Spitz, the lead dog of his sled team. After several '
                 "skirmishes with Spitz, Buck's decisive fight with him "
                 'occurs, and the result of the fight is a victory for Buck, '
                 'who then becomes the lead dog. In his position of '
                 'leadership, he quickly proves himself to be superior to all '
                 'the other dogs and thus wins the admiration of his masters, '
                 'François and Perrault, who work with Buck quite some time '
                 "before they are called away to other duties. Buck's next "
                 'master is a Scotch half-breed; the man is fair, but he works '
                 'Buck almost beyond endurance, so much so that on a difficult '
                 'run against extremely adverse conditions, most of the other '
                 'dogs succumb to the wild elements. Buck, however, survives, '
                 "even though he loses a significant amount of weight. Buck's "
                 'next change in life occurs when he and his team are sold to '
                 'three amateur adventurers — Charles, Hal, and Mercedes; they '
                 'have absolutely no concept of how to discipline the dogs or '
                 'even how to drive a team through the frozen northern snow. '
                 "As a result of their ineptitude, the dogs' food supply is "
                 'gone before the trip is half over. At this point, Buck sees '
                 'the futility of trying to continue; thus, he simply refuses '
                 'to return to the trace (the harness) despite the fact that '
                 'he is severely beaten. Propitiously, a man named John '
                 'Thornton appears and threatens the three owners if they '
                 "continue to beat Buck. Buck's instinct concerning the three "
                 'amateur adventurers proves to be correct; Charles, Hal, and '
                 'Mercedes continue on their way across the frozen snow and '
                 'ice and lose their lives, plus the lives of the rest of the '
                 'dog team when they try to cross a river of melting ice. All '
                 'are drowned. Meanwhile, John Thornton, who is recuperating '
                 'from frostbitten feet, nurses Buck back to health and wins '
                 'from Buck a deep devotion and loyalty. Yet, even though Buck '
                 'is tamed to a certain extent by the kindness of his new '
                 'master, at times while he sits with John Thornton in the '
                 'depths of the forest, Buck hears mysterious calls from the '
                 'wild — calls which awaken long-sleeping instincts within '
                 'him. As John Thornton returns to civilization with Buck, a '
                 'drunken miner attacks John Thornton and threatens to do him '
                 'harm. Buck immediately reacts and kills the man. Later on, '
                 'John Thornton is lost in some fast river rapids, and once '
                 "again Buck saves his master's life by swimming to him with a "
                 'tow line. On another occasion, Thornton makes a brag that '
                 'Buck can pull a sled with a thousand pounds loaded atop it. '
                 'Because of his great love for John Thornton, Buck finally '
                 'succeeds in moving the heavy sled one hundred yards. With '
                 'the money that Thornton wins from his betting feat, sixteen '
                 'hundred dollars, he goes deep into the wilderness in search '
                 'of a fabled lost gold mine. There, he works long and hard '
                 "hours, and while Thornton's men are panning for gold, Buck "
                 'often goes off by himself in the wilderness in order to '
                 'stalk wild animals, or catch salmon, or run with the wild '
                 'wolves; one time, he even spends four days stalking a huge '
                 'bull moose. Returning to camp, Buck discovers that everyone, '
                 'including John Thornton, has been killed by Yeehat Indians. '
                 'Without thinking and without fear, Buck attacks the entire '
                 'group of Indians, killing several and driving the rest away '
                 'in such fear that the valley in which Buck revenges his '
                 'master is from then on considered by the Indians to be a '
                 "demonic place. After John Thornton's death, Buck is free of "
                 'all his attachments to civilization, and so he joins the '
                 'wild wolves, and as legend has it, he becomes the sire of a '
                 'new breed of wild dogs which still exists in the wild places '
                 'of the Great North, loping through the cold nights, with '
                 'Buck leading them, singing "the song of the pack."',

                 "urging of his father, he becomes Danny's friend. Speaking of "
                 'himself, Danny tells Reuven that he will inherit his '
                 "father's position, as is common in the Hasidic tradition, "
                 'and become a rabbi, but he also admits that he would rather '
                 'become a psychologist. Reuven learns that Danny has been '
                 'raised in virtual silence — the only time Reb Saunders talks '
                 'to his son is when they study Talmud together. Danny '
                 'confesses that studying only the Talmud is boring and that '
                 'he secretly reads secular books in the public library. '
                 'According to Danny, even though Jews have an obligation to '
                 'obey God, sometimes he is not sure what God wants. Reuven '
                 'wants to become a rabbi but also has a strong interest in '
                 'math. Danny makes the perceptive and rather amusing '
                 "observation that he has to be a rabbi but doesn't want to be "
                 'one, and Reuven does not have to be a rabbi but wants to be '
                 'one. Reuven visits Danny at his home several times and '
                 'discusses the Torah and other writings with Reb Saunders and '
                 'Danny. During one of these visits, Reb Saunders talks to '
                 'Reuven privately. The Reb says that he knows that Danny has '
                 'been visiting the public library and wants to know what he '
                 'has been reading. Reuven tells Reb Saunders everything — how '
                 'Danny met Mr. Malter in the library and how his father '
                 'helped Danny select reading material. The Reb says that '
                 'Danny is so brilliant that he cannot talk to him, but he '
                 'also says with deep emotion that Danny is his most precious '
                 'possession. When Mr. Malter suffers a heart attack, Reb '
                 'Saunders invites Reuven to stay with him and his family '
                 "until Mr. Malter's health improves. Danny and Reuven spend "
                 'much time together discussing various literary and Jewish '
                 "subjects. When they visit Reuven's father in the hospital, "
                 'Mr. Malter talks passionately about the 6 million Jews '
                 'slaughtered by Hitler and the Nazis and how the American '
                 'Jews must help rebuild this human loss. He also supports '
                 'establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. Jews cannot wait '
                 'for the Messiah to come to aid them, he argues. They must '
                 "help themselves. Mr. Malter's position on Palestine "
                 'contrasts that of Reb Saunders, who says that Palestine '
                 'cannot become a Jewish state until the Messiah comes. Danny '
                 'and Reuven enter Hirsch College for the fall term. Danny is '
                 'upset that the college psychology department discredits the '
                 'work of Sigmund Freud, preferring instead the discipline of '
                 'experimental psychology. Mr. Malter gives a speech at '
                 'Madison Square Garden in New York City, urging an end to '
                 'British control of Palestine and the creation of a Jewish '
                 'state in its place. Reuven is moved by the speech, but Reb '
                 'Saunders is furious. He forbids Danny to associate with '
                 'Reuven. Reuven tells his father about this, adding that it '
                 "wasn't unexpected. Reuven says to his father that Reb "
                 'Saunders is a fanatic. Mr. Malter agrees but adds that the '
                 'fanaticism of people like Reb Saunders has kept the Jewish '
                 'people alive for the last 2,000 years. For the rest of the '
                 'semester, Danny and Reuven do not speak to one another. '
                 'Reuven finds the estrangement terrible to endure — his '
                 'grades suffer, and he constantly wonders what Danny is '
                 "thinking and how he's getting along. The conflict between "
                 'Reb Saunders and Mr. Malter continues. Reb Saunders '
                 'organizes his followers into a group called the League for a '
                 'Religious Israel. Mr. Malter continues speaking on behalf of '
                 'a Jewish state in Palestine. On November 29, 1947, the '
                 'United Nations decides to partition Palestine into an Arab '
                 'state and a Jewish state. Reb Saunders condemns the United '
                 "Nations' announcement and orders Jews to ignore it. The "
                 'state of Israel is formally proclaimed on May 14, 1948. '
                 "After the United Nation's action, Reb Saunders' anti-Zionist "
                 'stance fades in importance as far as the students at Hirsch '
                 'College are concerned. Danny is again permitted to speak to '
                 "Reuven, and their rift is healed. At his professor's "
                 'suggestion, Danny decides to pursue a Ph.D. in clinical '
                 'psychology, which means that he will have to renounce his '
                 "claim to his father's rabbinical position. Danny and Reuven "
                 'discuss how Danny should tell his father, and Danny also '
                 'gets advice from Mr. Malter. Ironically, Reb Saunders '
                 "already knows of Danny's decision. Through Danny, Reb "
                 'Saunders invites Reuven to his home for the Passover '
                 'holiday, and the two young men talk together with Reb '
                 'Saunders. The Reb recognizes that the boys have become men. '
                 'Reuven tells the Reb that he is going to become a rabbi. Reb '
                 'Saunders acknowledges that Danny has chosen a different '
                 'path; Danny has a brilliant mind and cannot be satisfied '
                 'within the confines of a Hasidic environment. The Reb trusts '
                 'that Danny will become a tzaddik for the world in his '
                 'practice of psychology. Danny and Reuven graduate from '
                 'Hirsch College. When Danny comes to say good-bye to Reuven '
                 'and Mr. Malter before leaving for graduate school at '
                 'Columbia University, Reuven notices that Danny has shaved '
                 'his beard and cut off his earlocks, two symbols of the '
                 'Hasidic faith. Mr. Malter says that Columbia University is '
                 'not so far away, so Danny should visit them often. The novel '
                 'ends as Danny agrees to visit the Malters and then leaves.',

 'summary_text': "Alice Walker's The Color Purple weaves an intricate mosaic "
                 'of women joined by their love for each other, the men who '
                 'abuse them, and the children they care for. In the first few '
                 'letters, Celie tells God that she has been raped by her '
                 'father and that she is pregnant for the second time with his '
                 "child. Celie's mother is quite ill and after cursing Celie, "
                 'dies, leaving Celie alone to face her father. Celie then '
                 'turns her attention to protecting her sister, Nettie, from '
                 "her father's sexual advances. Celie soon marries Mr. _______ "
                 '(later called Albert) after her father strikes a bargain '
                 'with the older widower, and Celie finds herself in a '
                 "loveless marriage, caring for her husband's four children "
                 'and being regularly raped and beaten. Celie becomes fixated '
                 "on Shug Avery, a glamorous blues singer who is her husband's "
                 'mistress. Several years later, Celie eagerly accepts the '
                 'responsibility of nursing Shug back to health, thus '
                 'beginning a lifetime of friendship and love between the two '
                 "women. The oldest of Celie's stepchildren, Harpo, marries an "
                 'independent young women, Sofia, and soon after, Celie '
                 'encourages Harpo to beat her into submission, just as all '
                 'men have beaten Celie. Sofia later confronts Celie about '
                 'this betrayal, but that confrontation leads to a deep and '
                 'enduring sisterhood, and Sofia remains an independent, '
                 'strong woman throughout the novel. The two women create a '
                 '"Sister\'s Choice" quilt together—the symbolism of quilts '
                 'permeates much of the novel. Just as scraps of cloth come '
                 'together to form a new, strong, useful product, so, too, can '
                 'black women come together to forge a similar strong and '
                 "useful bond. Sofia later punches the town's white mayor, an "
                 'act that lands her in prison and snatches the independence '
                 'she so values. By this time, she and Harpo have split up and '
                 "taken other lovers, so the women in Sofia's life take on the "
                 'responsibility of releasing her from jail. An alliance forms '
                 "between Celie, Shug, Sofia's sisters, and Squeak, Harpo's "
                 'mistress. When trying to help Sofia, Squeak is raped by her '
                 'uncle, the prison warden, but in telling her friends about '
                 'the rape, she becomes stronger, insisting that she will no '
                 'longer be called by her nickname and beginning to compose '
                 'her own blues music. Sofia is able to leave prison, but she '
                 'finds herself caged nonetheless, working as a maid in a '
                 'white household. Meanwhile, Nettie has become a missionary '
                 'in Africa and has written countless letters to Celie, all of '
                 'which Albert has hidden. Nettie, in spite of her upbringing, '
                 'is a self-confident, strong, faith-filled woman. When Celie '
                 "discovers Nettie's letters, she not only catches up on her "
                 "sister's life, she also discovers that her own two children "
                 'are alive and living with a missionary couple with whom '
                 "Nettie works. Nettie's letters about their shared African "
                 'heritage are a tonic to Celie, who becomes stronger and more '
                 'self-assured every day. That confidence soon turns to '
                 'fury—over her rapes, her beatings, and the love and '
                 "affection the men in her life have kept from her. Nettie's "
                 "letters also demonstrate parallels between Celie's world and "
                 'the African world, including the bond that can develop among '
                 'the multiple wives of African men, the deep friendship and '
                 'love that exists between two women, the deep love of a man '
                 'for a woman, and the unrelenting structure of sex roles. '
                 'With her new-found strength, Celie confronts her father, '
                 'whom she has just learned is her stepfather and not a blood '
                 'relative, and this brings great relief to Celie, who now '
                 'know that her children are not her brother and sister. She '
                 'also confronts Albert, leaves him, and moves to Memphis to '
                 'live with Shug, a move that stuns and pains Albert. In '
                 'Memphis, Celie, who started wearing pants when she gained '
                 'her strength and self-confidence, opens a business as a '
                 'pantsmaker. Later, after Shug has taken on a male lover, '
                 'Celie visits Albert, and they develop a new bond that '
                 'eventually grows into love and respect. Nettie, still living '
                 'in Africa, marries the now-widowed man who had adopted her '
                 "sister's children, thus becoming a mother to her niece and "
                 "nephew. Later, when Celie's father dies, she and Nettie "
                 'inherit his home, creating financial freedom for the two '
                 "women. At the novel's end, the two sisters are reunited, "
                 'while Albert and Harpo have learned to take on new roles in '
                 'the household and in their relationships. Note that the '
                 "novel's title is alluded to in Letter 12, when Celie "
                 'associates the color purple with royalty and longs for a '
                 'purple dress. But the title undoubtedly comes from a passage '
                 'near the end of the novel, in which Shug says that she '
                 'believes that it "pisses God off if you walk by the color '
                 'purple in a field somewhere and don\'t notice it."',

                 'black seventeen-year-old high school dropout named Alfred '
                 'Brooks, lives with his Aunt Pearl and her three daughters in '
                 'Harlem, a predominantly African American neighborhood in '
                 "Manhattan, New York City, in the mid-1960s. Alfred's father "
                 'deserted the family when Alfred was ten years old; his '
                 'mother died when he was thirteen. On both occasions, his '
                 'best friend, James, stood by him. Now, Alfred and James seem '
                 'headed in opposite directions. One Friday night in June, '
                 "James breaks into Epsteins' grocery with members of a street "
                 "gang led by the novel's antagonist, a bully named Major. "
                 'Alfred is a clerk at the store and inadvertently reveals '
                 'that there may be money in the cash register on a Friday '
                 'night; he forgets to tell James about the new alarm system '
                 'recently installed. Only James is arrested; he is put on '
                 'probation. Meanwhile, Alfred begins training at Mr. '
                 "Donatelli's Gym. A wise mentor, Donatelli insists that no "
                 'one is promised anything, everyone is treated equally, and a '
                 'man finishes what he begins. The journey, the climb, is more '
                 'important to Donatelli than the highest goal. Striving is '
                 'key. Alfred should try to become a contender and let the '
                 'championships of life come if they will, according to '
                 'Donatelli. Alfred begins training at the gym and progresses '
                 'well. As a spectator, he attends a fight night at Madison '
                 'Square Garden. When challenged later that evening, he is '
                 'able to stand up to Major, leader of the street gang. '
                 "However, Alfred's training is long and sometimes tedious. "
                 'Alfred cannot yet trust himself; he is too susceptible to '
                 "the opinions of others. Alfred's employers, the Epsteins, "
                 'seem to doubt him after the burglary. Eventually, Alfred '
                 "weakens. He attends a party at the gang's clubroom, indulges "
                 'in alcohol and marijuana, and passes out. Alfred sees James '
                 'at the clubroom and discovers that he has become addicted to '
                 'heroin. Both boys seem lost. After a hellish Sunday at Coney '
                 'Island with Major and the gang, Alfred decides to quit '
                 'boxing. When he visits the gym to clean out his locker, he '
                 'finds Mr. Donatelli alone. In attempting to apologize to his '
                 'mentor, Alfred finds that he does not really want to quit. '
                 'He needs to find out what he could become if he really '
                 'tries. He reaches a sort of epiphany, a moment of clarity '
                 'and self-awareness. He wants to become a contender . Alfred '
                 'resumes training with renewed enthusiasm. Soon, he is '
                 'allowed to spar, and in October he has his first amateur '
                 'fight at a union hall on Long Island. Alfred makes rookie '
                 'mistakes but wins. Especially impressive that night is an '
                 'older welterweight named Elston Hubbard. In November, Alfred '
                 'knocks out his second opponent but is terribly upset because '
                 'he thinks he has nearly killed the other fighter. His third '
                 'fight, in December, is a draw, because Alfred is reluctant '
                 'to throw a punch. Mr. Donatelli advises him that it is time '
                 'to quit. Alfred lacks the "killer instinct" necessary to go '
                 'very far, and he could be seriously injured in the ring. '
                 'Alfred has one more fight scheduled, and he insists on '
                 'finishing what he has started. Just before fight time, '
                 'Alfred, a lightweight, learns that his final opponent is '
                 'Elston Hubbard, the older, bigger, and stronger ex-Marine '
                 "who fought so well the night of Alfred's first fight. "
                 'Donatelli wants to cancel, but Alfred knows he must go on. '
                 'He barely survives the first two rounds and is dominated by '
                 'Hubbard. Nevertheless, Alfred finds a few tactics that work, '
                 'and the third round is a war. Standing toe-to-toe in a '

                 'skillfully docks the three-masted French ship, the Pharaon, '
                 'in Marseilles after its captain died en route home. As a '
                 'reward, Dantès is promised a captainship, but before he can '
                 "claim his new post and be married to his fiancée, Mercédès', "
                 'a conspiracy of four jealous and unsavory men arrange for '
                 'him to be seized and secretly imprisoned in solitary '
                 "confinement in the infamous Chateau d'If, a prison from "
                 'which no one has ever escaped. The four men responsible are: '
                 'For many years, Dantès barely exists in his tiny, isolated '
                 'cell; he almost loses his mind and his will to live until '
                 'one day he hears a fellow prisoner burrowing nearby. He too '
                 'begins digging, and soon he meets an old Abbé who knows the '
                 'whereabouts of an immense fortune, one that used to belong '
                 'to an immensely wealthy Italian family. Dantès and the Abbé '
                 'continue digging for several years, and from the Abbé, '
                 'Dantès learns history, literature, science, and languages, '
                 'but when at last they are almost free, the Abbé dies. Dantès '
                 "hides his body, then sews himself in the Abbé's burial sack. "
                 'The guards arrive, carry the sack outside, and heave the '
                 'body far out to sea. Dantès manages to escape and is picked '
                 'up by a shipful of smugglers, whom he joins until he can '
                 'locate the island where the treasure is hidden. When he '
                 'finally discovers it, he is staggered by the immensity of '
                 'its wealth. And when he emerges into society again, he is '
                 'the very rich and very handsome Count of Monte Cristo. Monte '
                 'Cristo has two goals — to reward those who were kind to him '
                 'and his aging father, and to punish those responsible for '
                 'his imprisonment. For the latter, he plans slow and painful '
                 'punishment. To have spent fourteen years barely subsisting '
                 'in a dungeon demands cruel and prolonged punishment. As '
                 'Monte Cristo, Dantès ingeniously manages to be introduced to '
                 'the cream of Parisian society, among whom he goes '
                 'unrecognized. But Monte Cristo, in contrast, recognizes all '
                 'of his enemies — all now wealthy and influential men. '
                 'Fernand has married Mercédès and is now known as Count de '
                 'Morcerf. Monte Cristo releases information to the press that '
                 'proves that Morcerf is a traitor, and Morcerf is ruined '
                 "socially. Then Monte Cristo destroys Morcerf's relationship "
                 'with his family, whom he adores. When they leave him, he is '
                 'so distraught that he shoots himself. To revenge himself on '
                 'Danglars, who loves money more than anything else, Monte '
                 'Cristo ruins him financially. To revenge himself on '
                 'Caderousse, Monte Cristo easily traps Caderousse because of '
                 "his insatiable greed, then watches as one of Caderousse's "
                 'cohorts murders him. To revenge himself on Villefort, Monte '
                 'Cristo slowly reveals to Villefort that he knows about a '
                 'love affair that Villefort had long ago with the present '
                 'Madame Danglars. He also reveals to him, by hints, that he '
                 'knows about an illegitimate child whom he fathered, a child '
                 'whom Villefort believed that he buried alive. The child '
                 "lived, however, and is now engaged to Danglars' daughter, "
                 "who is the illegitimate young man's half-sister. Ironically, "
                 "Villefort's wife proves to be even more villainous than her "
                 "husband, for she poisons the parents of Villefort's first "
                 'wife; then she believes that she has successfully poisoned '
                 "her husband's daughter by his first marriage. With those "
                 'people dead, her own son is in line for an enormous '
                 "inheritance. Villefort, however, discovers his wife's "
                 'plottings and threatens her, and so she poisons herself and '
                 'their son. At this point, Dantès is half-fearful that his '
                 'revenge has been too thorough, but because he is able to '
                 'unite two young people who are very much in love and unite '
                 'them on the Isle of Monte Cristo, he sails away, happy and '
                 'satisfied, never to be seen again.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Crucible takes place in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. '
                 'The action begins in the home of Reverend Parris, whose '
                 'daughter Betty lies unconscious and appears very ill. Around '
                 'midnight the night before, Parris had discovered Betty, his '
                 'niece Abigail, and Tituba, his black slave, dancing in the '
                 'woods, causing Betty to swoon. The local physician is unable '
                 "to determine the cause of Betty's illness. Mr. and Mrs. "
                 'Putnam arrive and reveal that their daughter Ruth is also '
                 'ill. There is talk in the village of an unnatural cause. '
                 "Abigail warns her friend Mercy Lewis and the Proctors' "
                 'servant Mary Warren, not to reveal that they were all '
                 'casting spells in the woods. Betty wakes, and Abigail '
                 'threatens the other girls with violence if they tell anyone '
                 'that she drank blood and cast a spell in order to kill Goody '
                 'Proctor. Betty loses consciousness again. John Proctor and '
                 'Abigail talk privately about their former relationship. '
                 'Prior to the opening of the play, Abigail worked as a '
                 'servant in the Proctor home. Elizabeth Proctor was ill at '
                 'the time and Abigail took on more responsibility within the '
                 'Proctor household. When Elizabeth discovered the affair, she '
                 'dismissed Abigail. During their discussion, Abigail becomes '
                 'angry with Proctor because he refuses to acknowledge any '
                 'feelings for her. Betty wakes again and is hysterical. The '
                 'well-respected Rebecca Nurse is visiting the Parris '
                 'household and calms her. Prophetically, Rebecca warns Parris '
                 "that identifying witchcraft as the cause of Betty's illness "
                 'will set a dangerous precedent and lead to further problems '
                 'in Salem. Mr. Putnam asks Rebecca to visit Ruth and attempt '
                 'to wake her. Ruth is the only Putnam child to survive '
                 'infancy, and Mrs. Putnam is jealous of Rebecca because all '
                 "of Rebecca's children are healthy, whereas Mrs. Putnam had "
                 'lost seven infant children. Putnam, Proctor, and Giles Corey '
                 'argue with Parris about his salary and other expectations. '
                 'Parris claims that a faction is working to drive him out of '
                 'town, and he disputes their salary figures. Putnam, Proctor, '
                 'and Corey then begin arguing over property lines and '
                 'ownership. Putnam accuses Proctor of stealing wood from land '
                 'that he does not own, but Proctor defends himself, stating '
                 'that he purchased the land from Francis Nurse five months '
                 'ago. Putnam claims Francis had no right to the land and, '
                 'therefore, could not sell it. Reverend Hale arrives from '
                 'another town to investigate the strange events in Salem. The '
                 'people of Salem have summoned him as an expert in witchcraft '
                 "to determine if witchcraft is behind the children's "
                 'illnesses. Hale learns that the girls were dancing in the '
                 'woods with Tituba, and that Tituba can conjure spirits. '
                 'Abigail blames Tituba for enticing her to sin. Hale then '
                 'questions Tituba, and she admits that she has seen the '
                 'Devil, as has Goody Good and Goody Osburn. Abigail also '
                 'confesses to witchcraft, stating that she had given herself '
                 'to the Devil, but that she now repents. Betty wakes up, and '
                 'she and Abigail name individuals that they say they have '
                 'seen with the Devil. Eight days later, Elizabeth discovers '
                 'that Proctor spoke to Abigail privately while in Salem. '
                 'Elizabeth and Proctor argue over this. Mary Warren comes '
                 'home from Salem where she is serving as an official of the '
                 'court, and gives Elizabeth a poppet (doll) that she made for '
                 'her while sitting in the courtroom. Mary Warren tells '
                 'Proctor that some of the girls accused Elizabeth of '
                 'witchcraft, but the court dismissed the charge because Mary '
                 'Warren defended her. Hale arrives at the Proctor house and '
                 'questions Proctor about his poor church attendance. He asks '
                 'Proctor to name the Ten Commandments. Proctor names nine '
                 'successfully, but he forgets the commandment forbidding '
                 'adultery. Hale questions Elizabeth as well. Proctor reveals '
                 'that Abigail admitted to him that the witchcraft charges '
                 'were false. Marshal Herrick then arrives and arrests '
                 'Elizabeth. Earlier that evening, Abigail feels a needle-stab '
                 'while eating dinner, and she accuses Elizabeth of attempted '
                 'murder. The authorities of Salem search the Proctor house '
                 'and discover the poppet, along with a needle. Hale questions '
                 'Mary Warren and learns that she sewed the poppet and stored '
                 'the needle inside. Mary Warren also tells him that Abigail '
                 'saw her sew the poppet and store the needle. Nevertheless, '
                 'Elizabeth is arrested. The court convicts Martha Corey and '
                 'Rebecca Nurse of witchcraft. Giles Corey tells the court he '
                 'has proof that Putnam is accusing his neighbors of '
                 'witchcraft in order to gain their land. Judge Danforth asks '
                 'the name of the witness who gave Corey the information, but '
                 'Corey refuses to cooperate. The court arrests him. Judge '
                 'Danforth informs Proctor that Elizabeth is pregnant. Mary '
                 'Warren tells the court that she pretended to see spirits and '
                 'falsely accused others of witchcraft. She reveals that '
                 'Abigail and the other girls are also lying. Abigail denies '
                 "Mary Warren's charge, however, and she and the others claim "
                 'that Mary Warren is sending out her spirit against them in '
                 "the court. Proctor denounces Abigail's charge against Mary "
                 'Warren, stating that Abigail is a lying whore. Proctor '
                 'informs the court of his affair with Abigail and states that '
                 'she is lying in order to have Elizabeth executed, thereby '
                 'providing herself with the opportunity to become his wife. '
                 'After Proctor agrees that Elizabeth would never lie, the '
                 'court summons Elizabeth and questions her about the affair. '
                 'Not knowing that her husband has confessed it, Elizabeth '
                 'lies about the affair and is returned to jail. Abigail '
                 'resumes her claim that Mary Warren is attacking her until '
                 'Mary Warren recants her confession that she lied about the '
                 "witchcraft and charges John Proctor as the Devil's man. "
                 'Several months pass. Proctor is in prison, scheduled to '
                 'hang, along with Rebecca Nurse. Elizabeth is also in prison, '
                 'although the court has delayed her execution until after she '
                 'gives birth. Hale attempts to convince the prisoners to '
                 'confess rather than hang, but all refuse. Proctor confesses '
                 'and signs a written affidavit, but he destroys the document '
                 'rather than have it posted on the church door. Proctor is '
                 'taken to the gallows.',

                 'about the young American girl to think her common and '
                 'vulgar, and consequently, refuses to meet her. During the '
                 'visit to the castle, Daisy learns that Winterborne has to '
                 'leave the next day. After teasing him about being under the '
                 'influence of some woman, she makes him promise to visit her '
                 'in Rome that winter. Some months later, Winterborne does go '
                 'to Rome and immediately hears that Miss Daisy Miller is '
                 'being "talked about." She is accused of picking up strange '
                 'men and being seen with them in indiscreet places. At the '
                 'house of a mutual friend, Mrs. Walker, Daisy meets and '
                 'teases Winterborne again. Soon she mentions that she is '
                 'going for a walk in order to meet a Mr. Giovanelli. Mrs. '
                 'Walker is shocked and tries to tell Daisy how improper it '
                 'would be to be seen walking the streets. Daisy solves this '
                 'by asking Winterborne to accompany her. After Daisy meets '
                 'her companion, the three of them stroll about for a while. '
                 'In a few minutes, Mrs. Walker drives up in her carriage and '
                 'tries to convince Daisy to come with her. She lets the girl '
                 'know how improper it is to be seen walking along the street '
                 'with a man. Daisy thinks that if what she is doing is '
                 'improper, then she is completely improper and asks the '
                 'others to forget about her. Later, at a party given by Mrs. '
                 'Walker, Daisy offends her hostess by coming very late with '
                 'her Italian friend. When Daisy leaves, Mrs. Walker snubs her '
                 'and later tells Winterborne that Daisy will never again be '
                 'allowed at her home. For some time, Winterborne hears '
                 'additional stories about Daisy, but he still maintains that '
                 'she is an innocent but impetuous girl. He even tries to warn '
                 'her about her indiscretions, but she is unconcerned. '
                 "Winterborne continues to believe in Daisy's innocence until "
                 'he passes by the Colosseum late one night. He enters to '
                 'observe the arena and accidentally sees Daisy with her '
                 'Italian friend. Then he realizes that she is not a young '
                 'lady that a gentleman need be respectful to. Winterborne '
                 'advises Daisy to leave immediately, and he questions the '
                 "Italian's intentions in bringing her there so late. A few "
                 'days after this, Daisy catches the Roman fever, which causes '
                 'her death. Three times during a period of consciousness, '
                 'Daisy sent Winterborne a message that he could only '
                 'interpret at a later date. He realized that Daisy was a very '
                 "innocent girl who would have welcomed someone's esteem. Note "
                 'to the reader: Henry James revised almost all of his work '
                 'for a final edition. Therefore, sometimes Daisy Miller '
                 'appears with four sections, as is found in the following '
                 'analysis. But it is just as possible to find it divided in '
                 'only two sections. In this division, Section 1 combines the '
                 'first two sections, that is, the episodes that take place in '
                 'Switzerland, and Section 2 handles the Italian episodes.',

 'summary_text': 'The novel traces the life of David Copperfield from the time '
                 'of his birth to his mature manhood, when he is married and '
                 'familiar with the vicissitudes of life. His early years are '
                 'enjoyable with his mother — who was widowed shortly before '
                 'his birth — and with her servant, Peggotty. Life is happy '
                 'for David until his mother decides to marry Mr. Murdstone; '
                 'afterward, life becomes unbearable for David. He is soon '
                 'sent to a miserable school where he becomes friendly with '
                 "James Steerforth, a fellow student. When David's mother "
                 'dies, he is taken from school and put to work by Mr. '
                 'Murdstone in a London warehouse. Although David enjoys the '
                 'company of the impoverished Micawber family, with whom he '
                 'boards, his other associates and the work are intolerable, '
                 'so, without money or property, he runs away to his Aunt '
                 'Betsey Trotwood in Dover. Despite a stern exterior, Aunt '
                 'Betsey treats him well, adopting him and sending him to a '
                 'good school. While at school, he boards with a Mr. Wickfield '
                 'and his daughter Agnes. (Throughout the novel, David retains '
                 'a fond, sisterly affection for Agnes.) After graduation, '
                 'David works in the law office of Spenlow &amp; Jorkins and '
                 "soon falls in love with Mr. Spenlow's daughter, Dora. About "

                 'marry Steerforth, whom David had innocently introduced to '
                 'her while she was engaged to Ham, a nephew of the Peggottys. '
                 'The family is saddened by this development, but Mr. Peggotty '
                 'sets out to find her and bring her back. David uses his '
                 'spare time doing clerical and literary work to help Aunt '
                 'Betsey, who now finds herself without financial resources. '
                 'He marries Dora, only to find that he has a "child-wife" who '
                 'knows nothing of housekeeping and cannot accept any '
                 'responsibility. Meanwhile, Uriah Heep, an "umble" clerk in '
                 "Mr. Wickfield's employ, whom David dislikes, has deceitfully "
                 "worked his way into a partnership, aided by Mr. Wickfield's "
                 'weakness for wine. In addition, David also discovers that '
                 'his old friend Mr. Micawber has gone to work for Heep. David '
                 'has remained fond of the Micawbers, and it troubles him that '
                 'his old friend is working for a scoundrel. Eventually, '
                 'however, Micawber has a grand moment of glory when he '
                 'exposes Heep as a fraud, helping to save Mr. Wickfield and '
                 "restoring some of Aunt Betsey's finances. David's wife, "
                 'Dora, becomes ill and dies, and David is troubled until '
                 "Em'ly, the Peggottys' niece, returns to her uncle. David has "
                 "felt guilty for some time for having introduced Em'ly to "

{'author': 'Willa Cather',
 'book_title': 'Death Comes for the Archbishop',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The episodic, nearly plotless narrative of Death Comes for '
                 'the Archbishop begins with a Prologue in which the Vatican '
                 'assigns Father Jean Marie Latour, a French Jesuit missionary '
                 'priest serving in Sandusky, Ohio, to the New Mexico '
                 "territory following the region's annexation to the United "
                 'States. Latour is elevated to bishop, and sets out for Santa '
                 'Fe with Father Joseph Vaillant, a personal friend from the '
                 "pair's schooldays. Latour and Vaillant are charged with "
                 'reinvigorating the Catholic Church in the region after '
                 'nearly three centuries of neglect. Although the region can '
                 'still be considered predominantly Catholic, the faith has '
                 'been usurped by rogue priests who have taken mistresses with '
                 'whom they have fathered children, abused the Mexican and '
                 'Indian natives, and exhibited greed. Latour sets out to '
                 'impart a disciplined approach to Catholicism in the '
                 'Southwest, meeting resistance from Padre Gallegos in '
                 'Albuquerque, Padre Antonio Jose Martinez of Taos, and Padre '
                 'Lucero of Arroyo Hondo. Gallegos is a hedonistic glutton and '
                 'gambler, Martinez a promiscuous libertine, and Lucero a '
                 'greedy liar. It takes Latour nearly a year to travel from '
                 'Ohio to New Mexico, traveling down the Mississippi River to '
                 'New Orleans, and then on to Galveston by steamboat. He loses '
                 'most of his possessions in Galveston, when the steamboat is '
                 'wrecked, but continues to travel by land across Texas and '
                 'into the New Mexico territory with a mare and a pack mule. '
                 'Upon arriving in Santa Fe, the Mexican priests refuse to '
                 "acknowledge Latour's authority. In order to clarify the "
                 'matter with the Archbishop of Durango, Latour sets out on a '
                 '3,000-mile journey. On his way, he gets lost. He is rescued '
                 'by a little girl who leads him to Agua Secreta (Hidden '
                 'Water). Here he learns that the priests of the region have '
                 'charged exorbitant amounts to perform the Sacrament of '
                 'Marriage, causing many of the natives to take wives without '
                 'benefit of marriage. While admiring the craftsmanship and '
                 'artistry of the native church, Latour recognizes that the '
                 'natives have allowed their own superstitions to permeate '
                 'their Catholic faith. Latour returns to Santa Fe with '
                 'documentation of his Vicarate, and finds that he has '
                 "endeared himself to many of the town's residents as his "
                 'presence has prompted some corrupt priests to resign their '
                 'posts. Vaillant sets out for Santo Domingo and Albuquerque, '
                 'in order to perform baptisms and marriages. The Indians of '
                 'Santo Domingo, however, are suspicious of Latour due to the '
                 'ill treatment they received from Spanish conquerors '
                 'centuries ago. In Albuquerque, he meets Manuel Lujon, a '
                 'wealthy landowner, with whom he barters for two mules. While '
                 'traveling to Mora together, Latour and Vaillant stop at a '
                 'house to escape bitterly cold rain and to seek a warm place '
                 'to rest. The house is inhabited by an older man and his '
                 'young Mexican wife. The wife warns the two priests to leave '
                 'as soon as possible because she fears her husband will kill '
                 'them. When they arrive in Mora, they are followed by the '
                 'woman. She tells the priests her name is Magdalena and her '
                 "husband's name is Buck Scales. She reports that Buck killed "
                 'four travelers on the Mora trail. Scales is subsequently '
                 'arrested and hanged, and Kit Carson takes Magdalena to live '
                 'with him and his wife near Taos. Latour and his guide, '
                 'Jacinto, travel west to the Indian missions. They spend time '
                 'in Albuquerque with Padre Gallegos. Gallegos, afraid that '
                 'Latour will ask him to accompany him on his visits to the '
                 'West, wraps his foot in bandages and complains that he has '
                 'gout. Latour and Jacinto push on to the pueblo of Isleta, '
                 'where they meet Padre Jesus de Baca. The elderly priest '
                 'lives in poverty among the Indians of the pueblo, claiming '
                 'only one possession@ — a wooden parrot. He tells Latour that '
                 'the Indians of Acoma own a portrait of St. Joseph that '
                 'possesses the miraculous power to bring rain. Latour earns '
                 'the admiration and respect of Jacinto. He tells Latour the '
                 'story of the elevated rock plateau of Acoma. Initially a '
                 'sanctuary for Indians seeking shelter from other marauding '
                 'tribes, a great church had been built in the '
                 'sixteenth-century by the missionary Fray Juan Ramirez. On '
                 'their return trip, Padre Jesus de Baca tells Latour the '
                 'story of Friar Baltazar Montoya, a seventeenth-century '
                 'priest of Acoma. Montoya virtually enslaved the Indians of '
                 'Acoma, forcing the women to carry water daily up the side of '
                 'the mountain to nourish his outlandish gardens. The Indians '
                 'were afraid that Montoya might possess magical powers beyond '
                 'the ability of the portrait of St. Joseph to bring rain. '
                 'Wishing others to admire his garden, Montoya plans a dinner '
                 'party. He invites several missionaries. During a story by '
                 'one of the priests, a serving boy becomes distracted and '
                 'spills a platter of gravy on one of the guests. An angry and '
                 'drunken Montoya throws a goblet at the boy, which kills him. '
                 'The guests leave, and the Indians revolt against Montoya by '
                 'throwing him from the plateau. Latour returns to Santa Fe, '
                 'and dismisses Father Gallegos. Vaillant replaces Gallegos, '
                 "replacing his predecessor's revelry with a more austere "
                 'devotion. Vaillant is dispatched to Las Vegas. On his way '
                 'back to Albuquerque, he stops to administer Last Rites to '
                 'residents of a Pecos Mountain village who are afflicted with '
                 'black measles. Vaillant becomes afflicted as well. Latour '
                 'travels to help his friend, and stops along the way to visit '
                 "Jacinto, his wife Clara and the couple's sick child. Latour "
                 'ponders the impact of white settlement among the Indians and '
                 'the diseases the whites have spread. Latour and Jacinto set '
                 'out toward Vaillant but encounter a blizzard. They seek '
                 'refuge in a cave that Jacinto confides has been used for '
                 'Indian ceremonies. Jacinto beseeches Latour to never mention '
                 'the cave to anyone@ — a request that Latour honors. The two '
                 'weather the storm in the cave and find Vaillant the '
                 'following day. Kit Carson is already there, and they take '
                 'Vaillant back to Santa Fe. Carson tells Latour about a white '
                 'trader named Zeb Orchard. Orchard is a recluse, but Latour '
                 'arranges a stay with him to learn more about Indian customs '
                 'and ceremonies. Orchard belittles Indian customs, but Latour '
                 "confesses that the Indians' veneration of customs and "
                 'traditions is similar to the Catholic faith. Latour and '
                 'Jacinto travel to meet Padre Antonio Jose Martinez, the '
                 'elderly priest of Taos. Informed by Kit Carson that all '
                 'white men were distrusted in Taos, Latour also learns that '
                 'Martinez is widely regarded as the instigator of an Indian '
                 'revolt that resulted in the murder of more than a dozen '
                 'white men, including the territorial governor. Seven Indians '
                 'were hanged for the murder, but Martinez was never indicted. '
                 'Instead, he convinced the Indians to sign over their worldly '
                 'possessions to him before they were executed, resulting in '
                 'Martinez becoming one of the wealthiest men in New Mexico. '
                 'Among the first things Latour learns upon meeting Martinez '
                 'is that he has fathered children. Martinez challenges Latour '
                 "on the Catholic Church's celibacy rule for priests. Martinez "
                 'claims the native priests are more devout than the French '
                 'Jesuits and warns Latour that enforcing "European '
                 'formalities" will result in "infidels and profligates." He '
                 'challenges Latour to dismiss him, saying he will form his '
                 'own church. Despite their disagreements, during High Mass '
                 "the following day Latour admires Martinez's singing voice as "
                 "well as the man's undeniable charisma. He discusses the "
                 'matter of Martinez with Mrs. Kit Carson, who tells him that '
                 'a disagreement with Martinez will set the Indians against '
                 'Latour. He confides to Vaillant that he will replace '
                 'Martinez eventually, but he will replace him with a Spanish '
                 'priest when he returns from a trip to the Vatican in Rome. '
                 'Latour returns from Rome a year later with four French '
                 'priests and one Spanish priest. He appoints the Spanish '
                 'priest, Father Taladrid, to replace Martinez, allowing him '
                 'the privilege to celebrate Mass upon Holy Days. When the '
                 'arrangement proves untenable to Taladrid, Latour decides in '
                 'favor of the Spanish priest. Martinez, infuriated, forms a '
                 'schismatic church with Padre Marino Lucero of Arroyo Hondo. '
                 'Lucero is depicted as an avaricious old man, given to '
                 'castoff clothing and austere eating habits. In response, '
                 'Latour sends Vaillant to strip Martinez and Lucero of the '
                 'rights and privileges of the priesthood. Although '
                 'excommunicated, the two priests continue their heretical '
                 'schismatic church until their deaths shortly thereafter. '
                 'While Martinez dies without repenting, Vaillant presides '
                 "over Lucero's reconciliation with the Church. Upon his "
                 'death, it is revealed that the miserly priest had saved '
                 'nearly $20,000 in American money. Latour becomes determined '
                 'to build a cathedral in Santa Fe. He enlists the financial '
                 'aid of Don Antonio Olivares, a wealthy Mexican rancher with '
                 'Dona Isabella, his American wife from Kentucky who was '
                 'raised as a Southern belle in Louisiana. The couple have a '
                 "daughter, Inez, who possesses none of her mother's beauty "
                 "but sings beautifully. At a New Year's party thrown by the "
                 'Olivares, Don Olivares pledges enough money for Latour to '
                 'build the cathedral. It is also where the character of Don '
                 'Manuel Chavez is introduced to the reader. A master '
                 'marksman, Chavez hunted Indians for sport as a young man. '
                 'Surviving an Indian attack that killed all fifty of his '
                 'companions, including his brother, Chavez walked sixty miles '
                 'to the future location of Fort Defiance. A follower of Padre '
                 'Martinez, Chavez distrusts Latour. Olivares dies before '
                 'bequeathing the promised cathedral monies to Latour. His '
                 'death begins a prolonged legal battle between Dona Isabella '
                 "and Olivares's brothers. The brothers claim that Inez is too "
                 'old to be the daughter of Dona Isabella, which Dona Isabella '
                 'will not refute for fear of revealing her age. Latour '
                 'convinces her to reject her vanity for the greater purpose, '
                 'and she consents. She eventually wins the lawsuit. Following '
                 'the Gadsden Purchase, which allowed the United States to '
                 'annex areas of southern New Mexico and Arizona, Father '
                 'Vaillant travels to Mexico to negotiate the establishment of '
                 'parish boundaries in the area. On his return, he is stricken '
                 'with malaria. Latour and Jacinto ride to Arizona, find '
                 'Vaillant, and bring him back to Santa Fe to recuperate. It '
                 "is the month of May, and Latour's orchard and garden are in "
                 "full bloom. Vaillant welcomes the respite in Latour's garden "
                 'as an opportunity to meditate on the Virgin Mary as he had '
                 'done when assigned to the Great Lakes region of the Midwest. '
                 'Vaillant considers May to be the month when all important '
                 'events occur in his life. Latour tells Vaillant he is eager '
                 'for him to stay with him in Santa Fe. Vaillant responds that '
                 'he hopes to be healthy enough for travel by July in order to '
                 'educate Catholics who have lapsed in their practices. He '
                 'equates the Indians with children who have no use for '
                 'property or financial gain. He relates an anecdote of an '
                 'Indian he has met who took him into a cave where his family '
                 'had hidden items for performing a Catholic Mass. The Indian '
                 'tells Vaillant that his family hid the items after the '
                 'Catholic mission from where they were kept was attacked by '
                 'Apaches. He believes the story of the artifacts is a parable '
                 'of the Catholic faith being buried in the frontier waiting '
                 'to be discovered. He convinces Latour that he must return to '
                 "his missionary work. The priests' conversation is "
                 "interrupted when Magdalena enters Latour's garden. Her "
                 'appearance is accompanied by a flurry of pigeons and doves, '
                 'and the priests are reminded of how much she has changed '
                 'since they first met her. The following December, Latour is '
                 'feeling that his efforts are having no impact on the area. '
                 'He wakes in the middle of the night to an early snowfall, '
                 'and walks to the church. In front of the church is a weeping '
                 'woman who Latour recognizes as Sada, a Mexican slave to a '
                 'local Smith family, Protestants who publicly belittle and '
                 'blaspheme the Catholic faith. The family refuses to allow '
                 'Sada to practice her Catholicism, and she has escaped for '
                 'the evening to pray in the chapel. Latour gives her his '
                 'cloak to wear and allows her into the church, where she '
                 'kisses the floor and prays with him. The experience allows '
                 'Latour to see the importance of his mission: "The church was '
                 'Sada\'s house, and he was a servant in it." When spring '
                 'arrives, Latour and Jacinto visit the Navajo Eusabio, who '
                 'has recently lost a son. Latour uses the visit to reflect on '
                 'his long friendship with Vaillant. Latour recognizes that '
                 'Vaillant may have been a poorer student but was always more '
                 'fervent in his faith. He recognizes that Vaillant is fond of '
                 'good food and drink but nevertheless rigidly observes fasts. '
                 "He also admires Vaillant's easy demeanor with new people. He "
                 "remembers a story of Vaillant's audience with the Pope "
                 'Gregory XVI. Instead of bringing the one customary item for '
                 'the pope to bless, Vaillant brought two suitcases of items. '
                 'He so delights the pope that the pontiff forgets several '
                 'subsequent engagements. Latour sends Jacinto to Arizona to '
                 'deliver a letter to Vaillant. Eusabio accompanies Latour on '
                 'his return to Santa Fe. During their travels, Latour notices '
                 'that the Indian way is to not disturb the landscape whenever '
                 'possible, whereas white men seem to assert themselves as '
                 "much as possible. Vaillant returns to Santa Fe at Latour's "
                 'command but wonders why he has been there for three weeks '
                 'with no reason being given. Latour takes his Vicar for a '
                 'ride to show him the rock he has selected as the stone for '
                 'the cathedral he plans to build. Vaillant is puzzled as to '
                 'why Latour is so emphatic about the design of the cathedral '
                 'and why he has been called back to Santa Fe. Latour receives '
                 'correspondence from the Bishop of Leavenworth, Kansas, that '
                 'the Gold Rush of Colorado has created a need for a priest to '
                 'serve the makeshift towns of tents and shacks that have '
                 'cropped up near Pikes Peak. Informing Latour that the '
                 'Colorado territory is under his domain, it is incumbent upon '
                 'him to assign the priest. Latour tells Vaillant that he will '
                 'fill the position. Although Vaillant is prepared to leave '
                 'immediately, Latour orders him to stay until a custom wagon '
                 'can be built and adequate provisions acquired. Vaillant '
                 'reflects on a murderer he visited in Chimayo. The criminal '
                 'was making a pair of boots for the patron saint of the '
                 'Chimayo church. His parents would come for his execution and '
                 'return home with the boots. Vaillant is certain the men to '
                 "whom he'll administer in Colorado will be less devout. "
                 "Vaillant's wagon takes a month to build. Latour recognizes "
                 'that the two will probably never work together again. '
                 'Vaillant considers the opportunity to serve in Colorado an '
                 'act of divine providence. Latour assures him that it was a '
                 'coincidence, because he called Vaillant back from Arizona '
                 'because of his loneliness. The Vicar leaves for Colorado, '
                 "and the Bishop's loneliness is mitigated by his recognition "
                 'of the presence of the Virgin Mary. He considers the wooden '
                 'carving of Mary in the Santa Fe church, and the Mexican '
                 'devotions to her in the form of clothing. He places their '
                 'work on equal footing with Raphael and Titian, who also '
                 "wardrobed the Virgin Mary in their art. Latour's premonition "
                 'that Vaillant would never return to work in New Mexico is '
                 'proven correct. The Vicar returns to Santa Fe to recuperate '
                 'from illnesses and to attend the formal proceedings marking '
                 "Latour's elevation to Archbishop. Vaillant's life in "
                 'Colorado is hard and cold, and he misses the mountains of '
                 'the Southwest. He suffers permanent injury when his wagon '
                 'falls into a ravine. His parishioners in Colorado, though '
                 'far more wealthy, are less giving than the peasants of New '
                 'Mexico, causing Vaillant to travel frequently to Santa Fe to '
                 'raise money for his church in Colorado. When the residents '
                 'of Santa Fe bestow ample gifts on Vaillant, Latour states '
                 "that he'll need a cart to deliver his cargo to Colorado. The "
                 'following morning, a cart is delivered. The two men say '
                 'their goodbyes, with the Archbishop declaring the Vicar "a '
                 'great harvester of souls, without pride and without shame." '
                 'The Archbishop spends his retirement years on an estate four '
                 'miles north of Santa Fe. He bought the acreage before his '
                 'retirement so that he could enjoy the orchard he planted. He '
                 'also builds an adobe house and a chapel. As a retiree, '
                 'Latour trains missionary priests. He spends much of his time '
                 'gardening. He receives Bernard Ducrot, a young Seminarian '
                 'who becomes a good friend to the Archbishop during his last '
                 'years. He contracts a fever and begins to speak nothing but '
                 'French. He asks the new Archbishop for permission to return '
                 'to his study in Santa Fe, and his request is granted. When '
                 'he returns to the city, he bemoans the number of wood-frame '
                 'houses that have become more prominent. His cathedral has '
                 'been built, and Latour observes the building by the light of '
                 'the Southwest sunset. Latour has come to love the New World '
                 'more than the Old, and he prepares to die in his adopted '
                 'homeland. Ducrot and Magdalena look after the Archbishop as '
                 'his health continues to fail. He ponders the hardships of '
                 'the missionaries in New Mexico, comparing them to the '
                 'deprivations of St. Paul and other early Christians. He '
                 'considers the hardships of the missionaries to be greater '
                 'due to the greater distances they have traveled from their '
                 'homelands. Latour remembers a story another priest had told '
                 'him about Father Junipero. Junipero had traveled with a '
                 'companion across a vast desert, arriving at a monastery in '
                 'good health with no provisions. The pair relates the story '
                 'of the gracious hospitality of a young Mexican family '
                 'consisting of a venerable man, his beautiful wife, an '
                 'infant, and a pet lamb. Junipero and his companion eat well, '
                 'sleep, and awaken to a table of food. The family, however, '
                 'is gone. The brothers recognize the landmarks depicted by '
                 'Junipero but have no recollection of a building or family '
                 'living there. Latour recognizes the family in the story as '
                 'the Holy Family and is charmed at the simplicity adopted by '
                 "the Divine Family. Latour's memories return to his decision "
                 'to leave France for America with Vaillant. He remembers '
                 'Vaillant faltering in his resolve and convincing his friend '
                 "to travel as far as Paris. Latour's encouragement was the "
                 'impetus Vaillant required to fulfill his pledge as a '
                 'missionary in the New World. Latour marvels at his '
                 "now-deceased friend's accomplishments despite his ill health "
                 'and setbacks. Among the setbacks faced by Vaillant is the '
                 'interest due on loans for property he purchased for the '
                 'Church. He is summoned to Rome to explain his complicated '
                 'financial arrangements before a papal court. Vaillant '
                 'returns to Colorado before he dies, and Latour travels to '
                 'his funeral. Also attending the funeral is Father Revardy, '
                 'who had served with Vaillant for more than twenty years. He '
                 "is in Chicago when he hears of Vaillant's death, but he "
                 'rushes back in ill health to attend the funeral of his '
                 'friend. Revardy arrives halfway through the funeral and is '
                 'immediately taken to the hospital afterward; he dies a few '
                 'days later. Latour recalls that his friend inspired such '
                 'devotion from men of all races. Recognizing that he has '
                 'outlived most of his oldest acquaintances, Latour is visited '
                 'by Eusabio. Eusabio relates that he traveled to Santa Fe '
                 'from Gallup in one day, whereas in the past it would have '
                 'taken two weeks. Eusabio is not encouraged by the progress '
                 'of civilization but is told by Latour that it is better to '
                 'not know the future. When Eusabio leaves, Latour tells '
                 'Bernard that he has seen two great wrongs righted in his '
                 'lifetime: the end of slavery and the restoration of the '
                 "Navajos to their rightful lands. Latour's admiration for the "
                 'nomadic Navajos is strong. He recognizes the injustices '
                 'committed against them by white men and Apaches alike. He '
                 'considers Kit Carson misguided for his role in eradicating '
                 "the Navajos. Carson had found the Navajo's hidden fields "
                 'located in a red-sandstone canyon and destroyed their corn '
                 'fields and orchards. The act so disheartened the Navajos '
                 'that that ceased to fight, and most of them were captured '
                 'and relocated. Eusabio arranged a meeting between Latour and '
                 'Manuelito, a Navajo leader. Manuelito is unable to convince '
                 'Latour to intercede between the Navajos and the U.S. '
                 'government, because Latour believes that a Protestant '
                 "country will not accept a Roman Catholic priest's "
                 'recommendations. The government changed its decision five '
                 'years later, and the Navajos were allowed to return to their '
                 'sacred lands. During his last days, Latour sleeps often and '
                 'eats little. His cathedral is full of parishioners who pray '
                 'for him. On his deathbed, he returns to the day he convinced '
                 'Vaillant to travel to Paris with him. Latour dies, and all '
                 "of Santa Fe's Catholics pray for him. His body is laid "
                 'before the high altar of the cathedral he built.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Death of a Salesman takes place in New York and Boston. The '
                 'action begins in the home of Willy Loman, an aging salesman '
                 'who has just returned from a road trip. Willy is having '
                 'difficulty remembering events, as well as distinguishing the '
                 'present from his memories of the past. His wife, Linda, '
                 'suggests that he request a job in New York rather than '
                 'travel each week. Linda and Willy argue about their oldest '
                 'son Biff. Biff and his brother, Happy, overhear Willy '
                 'talking to himself. Biff learns that Willy is usually '
                 'talking to him (Biff) during these private reveries. Biff '
                 'and Happy discuss women and the future. Both are '
                 'dissatisfied with their jobs: Biff is discontent working for '
                 'someone else, and Happy cannot be promoted until the '
                 'merchandise manager dies. They contemplate buying a ranch '
                 'and working together. At this point, Willy relives several '
                 'scenes from his past, including the time when, during high '
                 'school, Biff admits to stealing a football and promises to '
                 'throw a pass for Willy during the game. Willy also remembers '
                 'his old dream of the boys visiting him in Boston during a '
                 'road trip. Finally in his reverie, he relives the time that '
                 'Bernard, son of the next-door neighbor Charley, informs '
                 'Willy that Biff is failing math and will not graduate unless '
                 'his scores improve. In this last scene, Willy listens but '
                 'dismisses the important news because Biff is "well-liked," '
                 'and Bernard is not. Willy remembers a conversation with '
                 'Linda in which he inflates his earnings but is then forced '
                 'to admit he exaggerated when Linda calculates his '
                 'commission. Willy recalls complaining about his appearance '
                 'and remembers Linda assuring him that he is attractive. At '
                 "this point, Willy's memories begin to blend together. While "
                 'he is reliving his conversation with Linda, he begins to '
                 'remember his conversation with the Woman (a woman with whom '
                 'he had an affair). He is unable to separate memories of '
                 'Linda from the Woman. The play continues in the present with '
                 'his neighbor Charley coming over to play cards. However, '
                 'Uncle Ben appears to Willy while he is playing cards with '
                 'Charley, and Willy relives an old conversation with Ben '
                 'while simultaneously talking with Charley. As a result, '
                 'Willy becomes confused by the two different "discussions" he '
                 'is having — one in the present, one in the past — and he '
                 'accuses Charley of cheating. After Charley leaves, Willy '
                 "relives Ben's visit and asks Ben for advice because he feels "
                 'insecure since he did not really know his own father. Willy '
                 'also remembers instructing Biff and Happy to steal some '
                 'supplies from the construction site in order to remodel the '
                 'porch so that he can impress Ben. The play once again '
                 'returns to the present, in which Biff and Happy talk with '
                 'Linda about Willy. Biff and Happy learn that Willy is on '
                 'straight commission and has been borrowing money from '
                 'Charley in order to pay bills. Linda criticizes her sons for '
                 'abandoning their father in order to pursue their own selfish '
                 'desires, and she gives Biff a choice: Respect your father or '
                 'do not come home. Biff decides to stay in New York, but he '
                 'reminds Linda that Willy threw him out of the house. He also '
                 'tells Linda that Willy is a "fake." It is at this point that '
                 'Linda informs her sons that Willy is suicidal. Willy '
                 'overhears his wife and sons talking, and he and Biff argue. '
                 "When Happy describes Biff's plan to open his own business, "
                 'Willy directs Biff on what to do during his interview with '
                 "Bill Oliver. Willy remembers Biff's football games. Before "
                 'Linda and Willy go to bed, Linda questions Willy: She wants '
                 'to know what Biff is holding against him, but Willy refuses '
                 'to answer. Biff removes the rubber tubing Willy hid behind '
                 'the heater. The next morning Willy prepares to visit his '
                 'boss Howard to ask him for a job in New York. During the '
                 'meeting, Howard informs Willy that there are no positions '
                 'available in New York. Willy reminds Howard that he named '
                 'him, and he was a very successful salesman when he worked '
                 "for Howard's father. Howard remains impassive and instead "
                 'fires him. Upon being fired, Willy begins freefalling into '
                 "his memories of the past. Willy recalls Ben's visit once "
                 'again. This time, Willy asks for advice because things are '
                 'not going as he planned. He remembers Ben offering him a job '
                 'in Alaska. He accepts, but Linda intervenes and reminds him '
                 'of Dave Singleman. Willy shifts from his memory of Ben to '
                 "Biff's last football game. Willy recalls Charley pretending "
                 "he is unaware of Biff's game, and this infuriates Willy. "
                 "Willy's daydream ends when he arrives at Charley's office. "
                 'Bernard is waiting for Charley in his office. Willy and '
                 'Bernard discuss Biff and consider possible reasons for his '
                 'lack of motivation and success. Bernard says Biff changed '
                 'right after high school when he visited Willy in Boston. '
                 'Bernard questions Willy about what happened when Biff went '
                 'to visit him. Willy becomes defensive. Bernard is on his way '
                 "to present a case before the Supreme Court. Bernard's "
                 'success both pleases and upsets Willy. Charley gives Willy '
                 'money for his insurance payment and offers him a job, an '
                 'offer that Willy refuses. At a restaurant where Willy, Biff, '
                 'and Happy are to meet, Happy flirts with a young prostitute, '
                 'and Biff is upset because Oliver did not remember him. Then '
                 'Biff realizes that he was never a salesman for Oliver; '
                 'instead, he was a shipping clerk. Willy tells his sons that '
                 'he has been fired. Biff attempts to explain what happened '
                 'with Oliver (after seeing Oliver, Biff sneaked back into his '
                 "office and stole Oliver's pen); however, Willy is reliving "
                 'the past, recalling Bernard informing Linda that Biff has '
                 'failed math and will not graduate. Willy then remembers '
                 'Bernard telling her Biff has taken a train to Boston. Willy '
                 "relives the time when Biff finds out about Willy's affair "
                 "with the Woman: Biff comes to Willy's hotel room in Boston "
                 'to tell Willy that he will not graduate unless Willy can '
                 'convince Mr. Birnbaum to pass him. Willy recalls his own '
                 'desperate attempts to hide the Woman in the bathroom. When '
                 'the Woman comes out of the bathroom with Biff in the room, '
                 "Willy's plan to conceal the affair is ruined. Willy's final "
                 'memory is of Biff calling him a "fake" before walking out '
                 'the door. The play continues in the present when Stanley '
                 'reappears, and Willy realizes he is actually still in the '
                 'restaurant. Willy returns home and begins building a garden, '
                 'even though it is night. Linda throws Happy and Biff out of '
                 'the house. Ben appears to Willy while he is planting seeds. '
                 'At this point, Willy does not remember a previous '
                 'conversation with Ben, as he does several times earlier in '
                 'the play. Instead, he and Ben discuss his plan to commit '
                 'suicide. Willy and Ben converse in the present, but they are '
                 'talking about the future. Ben warns Willy that the insurance '
                 'company might refuse to pay a settlement and Biff might '
                 'never forgive him. Biff approaches Willy in the garden to '
                 'tell him he is leaving home for good. Biff and Willy argue, '
                 'and Biff confronts Willy with the rubber hose, saying he '
                 'will not pity him if he commits suicide. According to Biff, '
                 'the Lomans have never been truthful with one another or '
                 'themselves. Biff believes that he and Willy are ordinary '
                 'people who can easily be replaced. Biff and Willy reconcile. '
                 'Ben reappears to Willy and reminds him of the insurance '
                 'policy. Willy drives away. The Lomans, Charley, and Bernard '
                 "gather at Willy's grave.",

{'author': 'Christopher Marlowe',
 'book_title': 'Doctor Faustus',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Faustus becomes dissatisfied with his studies of medicine, '
                 'law, logic and theology; therefore, he decides to turn to '
                 'the dangerous practice of necromancy, or magic. He has his '
                 'servant Wagner summon Valdes and Cornelius, two German '
                 'experts in magic. Faustus tells them that he has decided to '
                 'experiment in necromancy and needs them to teach him some of '
                 'the fundamentals. When he is alone in his study, Faustus '
                 'begins experimenting with magical incantations, and suddenly '
                 'Mephistophilis appears, in the form of an ugly devil. '
                 'Faustus sends him away, telling him to reappear in the form '
                 'of a friar. Faustus discovers that it is not his conjuring '
                 'which brings forth Mephistophilis but, instead, that when '
                 'anyone curses the trinity, devils automatically appear. '
                 'Faustus sends Mephistophilis back to hell with the bargain '
                 'that if Faustus is given twenty-four years of absolute '
                 'power, he will then sell his soul to Lucifer. Later, in his '
                 'study, when Faustus begins to despair, a Good Angel and a '
                 'Bad Angel appear to him; each encourages Faustus to follow '
                 'his advice. Mephistophilis appears and Faust agrees to sign '
                 'a contract in blood with the devil even though several omens '
                 'appear which warn him not to make this bond. Faustus begins '
                 'to repent of his bargain as the voice of the Good Angel '
                 'continues to urge him to repent. To divert Faustus, '
                 'Mephistophilis and Lucifer both appear and parade the seven '
                 'deadly sins before Faustus. After this, Mephistophilis takes '
                 "Faustus to Rome and leads him into the pope's private "
                 'chambers, where the two become invisible and play pranks on '
                 'the pope and some unsuspecting friars. After this episode, '
                 "Faustus and Mephistophilis go to the German emperor's court, "
                 'where they conjure up Alexander the Great. At this time, '
                 'Faustus also makes a pair of horns suddenly appear on one of '
                 "the knights who had been skeptical about Faustus' powers. "
                 'After this episode, Faustus is next seen selling his horse '
                 'to a horse-courser with the advice that the man must not '
                 'ride the horse into the water. Later, the horse-courser '
                 "enters Faustus' study and accuses Faustus of false dealings "
                 'because the horse had turned into a bundle of hay in the '
                 'middle of a pond. After performing other magical tricks such '
                 'as bringing forth fresh grapes in the dead of winter, '
                 'Faustus returns to his study, where at the request of his '
                 'fellow scholars, he conjures up the apparition of Helen of '
                 'Troy. An old man appears and tries to get Faustus to hope '
                 'for salvation and yet Faustus cannot. He knows it is now too '
                 'late to turn away from the evil and ask for forgiveness. '
                 'When the scholars leave, the clock strikes eleven and '
                 'Faustus realizes that he must give up his soul within an '
                 'hour. As the clock marks each passing segment of time, '
                 'Faustus sinks deeper and deeper into despair. When the clock '
                 'strikes twelve, devils appear amid thunder and lightning and '
                 'carry Faustus off to his eternal damnation.',

{'author': 'Lord Byron',
 'book_title': 'Don Juan',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Don Juan was born in Seville, Spain, the son of Don José, a '
                 'member of the nobility, and Donna Inez, a woman of '
                 "considerable learning. Juan's parents did not get along well "
                 'with each other because Don José was interested in women '
                 'rather than in knowledge and was unfaithful to Donna Inez. '
                 'Donna Inez was on the point of suing her husband for divorce '
                 'when he died of a fever. The education of Juan became the '
                 'primary interest of his mother. She saw to it that he '
                 'received a thorough training in the arts and sciences but '
                 'took great care that he should learn nothing about the basic '
                 "facts of life. Among Donna Inez's friends is Donna Julia, "
                 'the young and beautiful wife of Don Alfonso, a middle-aged '
                 'man incapable of engaging her affections. When Juan is '
                 'sixteen, Donna Julia falls in love with the handsome young '
                 'man and finds opportunities to be in his company. One '
                 'midsummer evening the two declare their love for each other. '
                 'In November of that year Don Alfonso comes one night to the '
                 'bedroom of his wife accompanied by a crowd of his friends. '
                 'When he enters the room, his wife and her maid are ready for '
                 'him; the bedclothes have been piled up in a heap on the bed. '
                 "Don Alfonso and his followers search Donna Julia's suite for "
                 'a lover but find none. While searching, Don Alfonso becomes '
                 'the target of a tirade of abuse from his wife. The whole '
                 'company leaves, crestfallen. Don Alfsonso soon returns to '
                 "apologize and happens to find a pair of men's shoes in his "
                 "wife's bedroom. He leaves the room to get his sword. Don "
                 'Juan, who has been hidden under the heap of bedclothes, '
                 'prepares to make his escape by a back exit and runs into Don '
                 'Alfsonso. In the fight that ensues, Juan strikes Alfonso on '
                 'the nose and makes his escape. The sequel to these events is '
                 'that Donna Julia is sent to a convent and Don Alfonso sues '
                 'for divorce. Donna Inez decides that her son should spend '
                 'the next four years traveling. Don Juan embarks on a ship '
                 'bound for Leghorn, Italy, where his family has relatives. '
                 'Not long after the ship leaves port, a violent storm drives '
                 'it off its course. In spite of everything the crew can do, '
                 'the ship finally goes down with most of its passengers. Only '
                 'as many as can fit in a small cutter and a long-boat are '
                 'saved. Then the cutter is swamped and the nine men in it '
                 'drown. The men in the longboat, including Juan and his '
                 'tutor, are reduced to eating shoe leather. At this point one '
                 'of the survivors suggests cannibalism as a means of '
                 "survival. The lot falls on Juan's tutor. The arrival of the "
                 'boat at an island prevents the sacrifice of a second victim. '
                 'The boat is driven against a reef and overturns. By this '
                 'time only Juan and three others are left alive. By clinging '
                 'to an oar Juan is swept to the shore and manages to crawl up '
                 'on the beach, where he promptly collapses. The three others '
                 'perish. When Juan at last opens his eyes, he sees a lovely '
                 'young face peering into his. It is Haidée, the only daughter '
                 'of a Greek freebooter who has made the isolated Aegean '
                 'island his headquarters. Haidée and her maid help the weak '
                 'and emaciated Juan to a cave, where they gradually nurse him '
                 'back to health. Haidée does not dare bring Juan into her '
                 'home, for she knows that her father would sell him as a '
                 'slave. Inevitably Juan and Haidée fall in love and marry '
                 "without benefit of clergy. A month after Juan's arrival, "
                 "Lambro, Haidée's father, takes his fleet on a piratical "
                 'expedition. Sometime later word is brought back that Lambro '
                 'has died. Juan and Haidée move into his mansion as man and '
                 "wife. But the rumor of Lambro's death is false. When he "
                 'returns to his island port and walks toward his house, he is '
                 'surprised to see people idling, feasting, and entertaining '
                 'themselves. He does not make his presence known immediately. '
                 'At the time of his arrival, Juan and Haidée, attired in '
                 "gorgeous costumes, are feasting in Lambro's dining hall and "
                 'being entertained by a minstrel. After dining, Juan and '
                 'Haidée take their siesta. Haidée, for the first time, has an '
                 'ominous nightmare. She dreams that she is in a cave and that '
                 'Juan lies at her feet, wet and cold and lifeless. While she '
                 'is gazing on his face, his features slowly change into those '
                 'of her stern father. She awakes and there before her stands '
                 'the supposedly dead Lambro. When she arises and shrieks, she '
                 'awakes Juan. Clinging to him, she tells him that the '
                 'intruder is her father and beseeches him to beg his '
                 'forgiveness. She pleads with her father to spare Juan. '
                 'Lambro quietly commands Juan to surrender the saber he has '
                 "snatched from the wall. When Juan refuses, Haidée's father "
                 "draws and cocks his pistol. Haidée saves Juan's life by "
                 'throwing herself in front of him. Her father replaces his '
                 'pistol in its holster and blows a whistle. At once twenty of '
                 'his followers appear and attack Juan, who succeeds in '
                 'wounding two of them before being twice wounded himself. '
                 'When Haidée sees Juan cut down, a vein bursts in her body '
                 'and she collapses. For days she lies in a coma. When she '
                 'finally regains consciousness, she is apathetic and '
                 'speechless. The singing of a harpist at last draws from her '
                 'the response of tears. Then she arises and flies at all '
                 'those around her as if they were foes. Soon she lapses into '
                 'apathy again, and after twelve days she dies. Juan has been '
                 "carried on board one of Lambro's ships, where he finds "
                 'himself in the company of several other captives. Not long '
                 'after, he is brought to a slave market in Constantinople. In '
                 'the slave market Juan and a fellow captive, an Englishman '
                 'named Johnson, are bought by the eunuch Baba for Gulbeyaz, '
                 'the fourth wife of the sultan, who has seen Juan being led '
                 'to the market and who wants him for herself. They are '
                 'brought to the royal palace, where Juan is dressed in '
                 'woman\'s clothes. "Juanna" is then conducted to the '
                 "sultana's apartment. She commands him to make love to her. "
                 'But he is still faithful to the memory of Haidée and burst '
                 'into tears. The sultana throws her arms around him, but Juan '
                 'disengages himself. At first, the sultana is enraged, but '
                 'her mood soon changes to tears. Her tears move Juan and he '
                 '"began to stammer some excuses," but at this point the '
                 'interview is ended by the announcement that the sultan is '
                 "coming. The sultan notices Juan among the sultana's women "
                 'and remarks that it is a pity that a Christian should be so '
                 'pretty. This remark draws the glances of all to the person '
                 'of Juan. Juan is placed in an apartment of the palace where '
                 "many of the sultan's concubines are quartered, for it is "
                 "assumed that he is a new member of the sultan's large harem. "
                 'He is assigned to a pretty girl named Dudji as a companion. '
                 'During the night the whole harem is awakened by a loud '
                 'scream from Dudji. She is pressed for an explanation. She '
                 'has dreamed, she says, that she was walking in a wood in '
                 'which there was a tree with a golden apple. The golden apple '
                 'fell at her feet, but when she picked it up to bite into it, '
                 'a bee flew out and stung her. The eunuch Baba reports the '
                 'next morning to the sultana that Juan and Dudji shared '
                 'quarters during the night but says nothing of the dream. '
                 'When Gulbeyaz hears this, her cheeks become ashen. She '
                 'commands Baba to bring Juan and Dudji to her. The setting of '
                 'Canto VII is Ismail, a Turkish fortress on the Danube, which '
                 'is being besieged by the Russians. Here arrive, by steps '
                 'which Byron omits, a party from Constantinople made up of '
                 'Juan, Johnson, two unidentified Turkish women, and a eunuch. '
                 'They are brought to General Suwarrow, the ruthless and '
                 'efficient commander of the Russians. Johnson had served in '
                 'the Russian army before, and Suwarrow assigns him to his old '
                 'regiment. Juan he assigns to himself. Johnson requests the '
                 'general that the Turkish ladies and their attendant be given '
                 'kind treatment because they have helped himself and Juan '
                 'escape from Constantinople. The final assault on Ismail '
                 'begins. The Turks resist with valor and before the fortress '
                 'is captured rivers of blood have been shed. Juan, swept away '
                 'by a thirst for glory, proves himself to be a soldier of '
                 'prowess and courage, but at the same time shows his '
                 'humanitarianism by rescuing a little Turkish orphan girl '
                 'from a pair of Cossacks who are about to slay her. Juan, now '
                 'a lieutenant in the Russian army, is selected because of his '
                 'valor and humanity to carry the news of the victory to the '
                 'Empress Catherine in Petersburgh. He takes Leila, the young '
                 'Turkish girl, with him. The Empress Catherine is so much '
                 'taken with the appearance of the handsome youthful '
                 'lieutenant that when he presents her with his dispatch, she '
                 'does not at once break the seal. When she finally does so, '
                 'she is filled with joy. She falls in love at first sight '
                 'with the bearer of the good news. Juan is swept off his feet '
                 'by the attention he receives from Catherine. She promptly '
                 'makes him a favorite and showers him with wealth. Because of '
                 'the position he so quickly gains and because of his gracious '
                 'demeanor, he becomes the center of attention in the Russian '
                 'court. Juan soon finds himself quite at home in Petersburgh '
                 'and "Seduced by Youth and dangerous examples" grows a little '
                 'dissipated. He lives "in a hurry / Of waste and haste, and '
                 'glare, and gloss and glitter." He is courted by everyone. '
                 'For a while all goes well; then he falls sick. The doctors '
                 'conclude that the climate is too cold for him, and '
                 'Catherine, much against her wishes, decides to send him on '
                 'an official mission to England. He leaves Russia for England '
                 'laden with gifts and honors, taking with him his little '
                 'orphan Leila. In England Juan quickly becomes the object of '
                 'as much attention as he had been in Russia. He is known to '
                 'have come on an important mission; he is handsome, young, '
                 'and accomplished; he knows several languages; and "Some '
                 'rumour also of some strange adventures / Had gone before '
                 'him, and his wars and loves." He is well received '
                 'everywhere. He passes his mornings in business, his '
                 'afternoons in visits, and his evenings in dancing and other '
                 "forms of entertainment. One of Juan's first problems to be "
                 'solved in England is what to do with little Leila. He '
                 'finally decides to place her in the care of Lady Pinchbeck, '
                 'who is elderly, virtuous, wise in the ways of the world, and '
                 'interested in the Turkish orphan. Diplomatic business often '
                 'brings Juan in contact with Lord Henry Amundeville, who '
                 'takes a liking to the young Spaniard, as does his wife, Lady '
                 "Adeline. Juan is frequently a guest in Lord Henry's mansion "
                 'in London. When the winter season in London is over, the '
                 'Amundevilles leave for their country estate, Norman Abbey. '
                 'When autumn comes the Amundevilles invite a large number of '
                 'guests, including Juan, to the abbey. Juan acquits himself '
                 'well in the country. He proves to be good at fox-hunting, '
                 'riding, dancing, and all the other activities of country '
                 'life among the aristocracy. Lady Fitz-Fulke, who is living '
                 'apart from her husband, begins to take a special interest in '
                 'him. When Lady Adeline notices this, she resolves to save '
                 'Juan from Lady Fitz Fulke, who has a reputation for getting '
                 'involved in intrigues. Lady Adeline has a weakness of her '
                 'own: Her heart is vacant. She loves her husband, or thinks '
                 'she does, but that love costs her an effort. She is also of '
                 'the same age as Juan, namely twenty-one. Lady Adeline tells '
                 'Juan that she thinks he ought to get married. Juan makes a '
                 'polite reply. She names a number of what she considers good '
                 'matches but fails to mention Aurora Raby, who is rich, '
                 'noble, young, pretty, sincere, and a Catholic like Juan. '
                 'This omission makes Juan wonder and he brings the fact to '
                 'the attention of Adeline. Lady Adeline marvels "what he saw '
                 'in such a baby / As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?" '
                 '(Canto XV, St. 49). One evening Juan sits beside Aurora at '
                 'dinner. She pays no attention to him, a phenomenon which '
                 'piques him and arouses his interest in her. That night Juan, '
                 'unable to sleep, walks out into a gallery filled with '
                 'portraits of the eminent or beautiful dead. Much to his '
                 'astonishment he sees a monk in cowl, robe, and beads. The '
                 'monk slowly walks by him and disappears. As Juan has heard '
                 'that the ghost of a monk haunts Norman Abbey, in his fear he '
                 'assumes that he has seen this very ghost The next morning '
                 'Juan is unusually pensive at breakfast Lord Henry remarks '
                 'that he looks as if he had seen the ghost of the Black '
                 'Friar. Juan does not admit what he has seen. Adeline then '
                 'sings the song of the Black Friar, a song she has composed '
                 "about the ghost of Norman Abbey. The song restores Juan's "
                 'spirits. That night Juan is again unable to sleep and again '
                 'he hears the deliberate footsteps he heard the night before. '
                 'Suddenly his door flies open. In the doorway stands the '
                 "friar. Juan's dread turns to anger and he advances toward "
                 'the ghost. The ghost retreats until it is backed up against '
                 'a wall. Juan stretches out his arm and touches the solid '
                 'breast of "her frolic Grace-Fitz-Fulke!" The following '
                 'morning Juan looks "wan and worn." The Duchess Fitz-Fulke '
                 '"had a sort of air rebuked — / Seemed pale and shivered . . '
                 '." (St. 14).',

{'author': 'Miguel de Cervantes',
 'book_title': 'Don Quixote',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Alonso Quixano, a less-than-affluent man of fifty, "lean '
                 'bodied" and "thin faced, lives modestly in the Spanish '
                 'country village of La Mancha with his niece, Antonia, and a '
                 'cranky housemaid. Practical in most things, compassionate to '
                 'his social peers, the local clergy, and the servant classes, '
                 'Quixano is respectful toward the ruling classes, whom he '
                 'unquestioningly accepts as his superiors. He is driven '
                 'neither by ambition for wealth and position nor bitterness '
                 "at his genteel poverty. Well read and thoughtful, Quixano's "
                 'most prized possessions are his books. From his readings and '
                 'studies, he becomes by degrees interested, then obsessed, '
                 'with the codes, deeds, and tales of chivalry — of knights '
                 'errant on some courtly and idealized mission. As his '
                 'appetite for the lore of chivalry increases, Quixano begins '
                 'selling off acres of his farmlands, using the funds to buy '
                 'more books, and increasingly throwing himself into his '
                 'studies. "From little sleep and too much reading his brain '
                 'dried up and he lost his wits. He had a fancy . . . to turn '
                 'his passion knight errant and travel through the world with '
                 'horse and armor in search of adventures" with the purpose of '
                 '"redressing all manner of wrongs." At length, he is '
                 'galvanized into action by his passion for the chivalric '
                 'code. Outfitting himself with some old rusty armor, Quixano '
                 'enlists his spavined hack horse to go forth in search of '
                 'knightly adventures. Hopeful of finding a proper noble to '
                 'dub him, Quixano finally is licensed in his venture by an '
                 'innkeeper who believes him to be a lord of a manor. Now '
                 'Quixano is "Don Quixote de La Mancha"; the tired hack and '
                 'dray horse becomes elevated to "Rosinante." All the new '
                 'knight needs now in order to venture forth is a lady to '
                 'whose service he is sworn and a servant or page. For the '
                 'former, he chooses Dulcinea del Tobosa, named after Aldonza '
                 'Lorenzo, a farm girl whom he had been taken with at one '
                 'time. After three days on the road, Quixote encounters a '
                 'group of traveling salesmen whom he attacks after they '
                 "refuse to acknowledge Dulcinea's great beauty. He is badly "
                 'beaten by the servant of the salesman and forced to accept '
                 'the help of a neighbor, who brings him home on the back of a '
                 'donkey. While he is recovering, Quixote is forced to watch '
                 'as his housekeeper, a barber, and a priest burn all his '
                 'books on chivalry in an attempt to persuade him to give up '
                 "his improbable quest. But this only fuels Quixote's "
                 'determination. He persuades Sancho Panza, a plump, '
                 'simple-minded-but-opportunistic laborer, to serve as his '
                 'page, by playing on his ambitions. Don Quixote promises '
                 'Sancho his own island to govern, for surely such a splendid '
                 'knight as he is sure to become will soon take many spoils. '
                 'And so this pair set forth, Quixote on his spavined old '
                 'horse, Panza mounted on Dapple, his mule. Their second '
                 'adventure lasts for three weeks and is comprised of a series '
                 'of events that comprise the balance of Book One. Among other '
                 'things, Quixote battles windmills, thinking them to be '
                 'giants. At an inn, which he mistakes for a castle, Quixote '
                 'is visited in bed by a maid, who causes a great uproar when '
                 'she discovers she has come to the wrong room. Refusing to '
                 'pay the bill and accusing the innkeeper of being '
                 'inhospitable, Quixote is rousted, only to fall promptly into '
                 'another misadventure with a religious procession, and yet '
                 'other ironic and error-prone encounters with locals. '
                 'Interspersed among these adventures are a series of stories '
                 'and moral tales, illustrating the pastoral storytelling '
                 'tradition in Spain. As well, there are two long, learned '
                 'disquisitions, delivered by Quixote. The first is a '
                 'description of the Golden Age of mythology, told during a '
                 "supper shared with some unlettered goatherds who don't "
                 'understand a word he says. Later on, Quixote addresses a '
                 'company during dinner at an inn in a debate about whether '
                 'the career of arms is superior to that of letters, or vice '
                 'versa. Throughout the adventures it becomes clear that '
                 'Quixote, for all his seeming madness, is a mild-mannered, '
                 'empathetic man, genuine in his concern for chivalric ideals. '
                 'Although he has agendas of his own, Sancho Panza has come to '
                 'believe in and show loyalty to his new master. But in spite '
                 "of all his good intentions, Quixote's quest leads him to be "
                 'returned home, imprisoned in a cage on an ox-cart by his '
                 "village priest and barber for Don Quixote's own good. "
                 "Published in a separate volume, Book Two of Don Quixote's "
                 'adventures contains a unique feature. Shortly after Book One '
                 'was published and Cervantes was at work on Book Two, he got '
                 'word of the appearance of a pirated Book Two in which the '
                 'author, a writer named Avellaneda, presumed to write further '
                 'adventures of the knight, going so far as to renounce his '
                 'service to Dulcinea. Cervantes was at Chapter 59 in Book '
                 'Two, having Quixote and Panza headed to a jousting '
                 'tournament in Saragossa. Now, angered by the pirated '
                 'version, Cervantes sets forth in revenge by having Quixote '
                 'and Panza eating dinner at an inn and "overhearing" talk of '
                 'the Avellaneda version. The knight and squire promptly set '
                 'forth to Barcelona, home of Don Alvaro Tarfe, a character '
                 'from the Avellaneda book. When they arrive in Barcelona, '
                 'they kidnap the Avellaneda character. Book Two also '
                 'introduces the character of Samson Carrasco, a young man '
                 "from Don Quixote's village. A recent graduate of Salamanca "
                 'University, Carrasco takes on the earlier roles of the '
                 'priest and the barber in attempting to rescue and keep Don '
                 'Quixote away from danger, but Don Quixote is not interested '
                 'in being "rescued." He is determined to go to Tobosa to pay '
                 'his respects to Dulcinea. They encounter three peasant girls '
                 'and by some deception, Sancho hopes that his master will '
                 'accept one of these as being Dulcinea. When events or '
                 'appearances run counter to his expectations, Don Quixote '
                 'tends to believe that enchanters have worked their mischief. '
                 'In this instance, he believes enchanters have made Dulcinea '
                 'look like an ugly peasant girl. Don Quixote unexpectedly '
                 'wins a battle with a knight (The Knight of the Mirrors), who '
                 'turns out to be none other than Samson Carrasco in disguise. '
                 'Samson had hoped to get the Don back home to safety by '
                 'disguising himself as a rival knight. The plan backfires. '
                 'Shortly afterwards, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza meet the '
                 '"Knight in the Green Topcoat," which includes the episode of '
                 'the lion with whom the Don wants to do battle. The major '
                 'portion of this section is devoted to an unnamed duke and '
                 'duchess who, with their retainers, play a series of pranks — '
                 'in the form of burlesque pageants — on Quixote. They also '
                 'cause injury to both the knight and his squire. Another '
                 'vital element is the appointment of Sancho Panza as governor '
                 'of an island — another elaborate prank that ends with Panza '
                 'renouncing the life of a feudal governor and showing a deep '
                 'layer of loyalty to Quixote. Once again Samson Carranzo '
                 'appears, this time at the beach in Barcelona where, in the '
                 'guise of The Knight of the White Moon, he challenges Don '
                 'Quixote to battle. Of course, Quixote accepts the challenge '
                 'and, in the presence of the viceroy and a distinguished '
                 "company, is roundly defeated. A condition of Quixote's "
                 'defeat is that he abandon knight errantry for the rest of '
                 'his life. In the remaining chapters, Don Quixote and Sancho '
                 'Panza return to La Mancha, but not before they experience an '
                 'additional stay with the Duke and Duchess and sundry other '
                 'humiliating experiences suffered by the ex-knight. When they '
                 'arrive home, Don Quixote, apparently broken in spirit, is '
                 'put to bed. After a long sleep, he declares his name to be '
                 'Alonso Quixano once more and appears to have regained his '
                 'reason. Shortly after he denounces chivalry and knighthood, '
                 'he dies among the lamentation of friends.',

 'summary_text': 'Every Sunday, Mr. Utterson, a prominent London lawyer, and '
                 'his distant kinsman, Mr. Richard Enfield, take a stroll '
                 "through the city of London. Even though to a stranger's "
                 'eyes, these two gentlemen seem to be complete opposites, '
                 'both look forward to, and enjoy, their weekly stroll with '
                 'one another. One Sunday, they pass a certain house with a '
                 'door unlike those in the rest of the neighborhood. The door '
                 'reminds Mr. Enfield of a previous incident in which he '
                 'witnessed an extremely unpleasant man trampling upon a '
                 'small, screaming girl while the strange man was in flight '
                 'from something, or to somewhere. The screams from the small '
                 'girl brought a large crowd, and various bystanders became '
                 'incensed with the indifference of the stranger, whose name '
                 'they discovered to be Mr. Edward Hyde. Enfield can recall '
                 'the man only with extreme distaste and utter revulsion. The '
                 'crowd forced the man to make retribution in the form of '
                 'money, and they were all surprised when he returned from '
                 'inside the "strange door" with ten pounds in gold and a '
                 'check for ninety pounds. They held him until the banks '
                 'opened to make certain that the check was valid because it '
                 'was signed by the well-known Dr. Henry Jekyll, and they '
                 'suspected that it was a forgery. To their amazement, the '
                 'check was valid. That evening, in his apartment, Mr. '
                 'Utterson has further reason to be interested in Mr. Hyde '
                 "because Dr. Jekyll's will has an unusual clause that "
                 'stipulates that Edward Hyde is to be the sole beneficiary of '
                 "all of Jekyll's wealth and property. Utterson goes, "
                 'therefore, to visit an old friend, Dr. Lanyon, who tells him '
                 'that some ten years ago, he and Dr. Jekyll became estranged '
                 'because of a professional matter. Utterson decides to seek '
                 'out Hyde, and he posts himself as a sentinel outside the '
                 'mysterious door previously mentioned by Enfield. After some '
                 'time, Utterson encounters the man Hyde entering the door, '
                 'and he initiates a conversation with him. Hyde suddenly '
                 "becomes highly suspicious of Utterson's interest in him and "
                 'quickly retreats inside the door. Utterson walks around the '
                 "block and knocks at the front door of Dr. Jekyll's house. "
                 'Upon questioning the butler, Poole, Utterson discovers that '
                 "Edward Hyde has complete access to Jekyll's house. About a "
                 "fortnight later, Utterson is invited to one of Jekyll's "
                 'dinner parties and remains after the other guests have left '
                 'so that he can question Jekyll about his will and about his '
                 'beneficiary, Edward Hyde. Jekyll is unhappy discussing '
                 'Edward Hyde and insists that his wishes — that Mr. Hyde be '
                 'the recipient of his property — be honored. About a year '
                 'later, an upstairs maid witnesses the vicious murder of a '
                 'kindly and distinguished old gentleman, the prominent Sir '
                 'Danvers Carew, M.P. (Member of Parliament). But the '
                 'assailant escapes before he can be apprehended. The maid, '
                 'however, is able to positively identify the murderer as '
                 "Edward Hyde. Mr. Utterson and the police go to Hyde's "
                 'apartment, but the housekeeper informs them that he is gone. '
                 'When Utterson confronts Jekyll about the whereabouts of '
                 'Hyde, Jekyll shows the lawyer a letter which Hyde wrote '
                 'saying that he was disappearing forever. Jekyll maintains '
                 'that he himself is completely through with him. After the '
                 'disappearance of Hyde, Jekyll comes out of his seclusion and '
                 'begins a new life, for a time. But at about the same time, '
                 'Utterson is dining with his friend, Dr. Lanyon, and he notes '
                 'that Dr. Lanyon seems to be on the verge of a complete '
                 'physical collapse; Lanyon dies three weeks later. Among his '
                 'papers is an envelope addressed to Utterson, and inside is '
                 'an inner envelope, sealed with instructions that this '
                 "envelope should not be opened until after Jekyll's death or "
                 'disappearance. Utterson strongly feels that the contents of '
                 'the envelope contain information about Edward Hyde. On '
                 'another Sunday walk, Utterson and Enfield pass along the '
                 'street where Enfield saw Hyde trampling on the young girl. '
                 'They step around the corner into the courtyard and see Dr. '
                 'Jekyll in an upstairs window. Utterson invites Jekyll to '
                 "accompany them on a walk, but suddenly Jekyll's face is "
                 'covered with abject terror and, after a grimace of horrible '
                 'pain, he suddenly closes the window and disappears. Utterson '
                 'and Enfield are horrified by what they have seen. Some time '
                 "later, Utterson receives a visit from Poole, Dr. Jekyll's "
                 'man servant. Poole suspects that foul play is associated '
                 'with his employer; Dr. Jekyll, he says, has confined himself '
                 'to his laboratory for over a week, has ordered all of his '
                 'meals to be sent in, and has sent Poole on frantic searches '
                 'to various chemists for a mysterious drug. Poole is now '
                 'convinced that his employer has been murdered and that the '
                 "murderer is still hiding in Jekyll's laboratory. Utterson is "
                 "sufficiently convinced that he returns to Jekyll's house, "
                 'where he and Poole break into the laboratory. There, they '
                 'discover that the mysterious figure in the laboratory has '
                 'just committed suicide by drinking a vial of poison. The '
                 'body is that of Edward Hyde. They search the entire building '
                 'for signs of Jekyll and can find nothing, except a note '
                 'addressed to Utterson. The note informs Utterson that he '
                 'should go home and read, first, the letter from Dr. Lanyon '
                 'and then the enclosed document, which is the "confession" of '
                 "Dr. Henry Jekyll. Dr. Lanyon's narrative reveals that Dr. "
                 'Jekyll had written to him, in the name of their old '
                 'friendship, and had requested him to follow precise '
                 "instructions: go to Jekyll's laboratory, secure certain "
                 "items, bring them back to his house, and at twelve o'clock "
                 'that night, a person whom Lanyon would not recognize would '
                 'call for these things. Lanyon writes that he followed the '
                 "instructions precisely and at exactly twelve o'clock, a "
                 'horribly disagreeable, misbegotten "creature" appeared at '
                 'the laboratory to claim the items for Dr. Jekyll. Before '
                 'leaving, he asked for a "graduated glass," proceeded to mix '
                 'the powders and liquids, and then drank the potion. To Dr. '
                 "Lanyon's horror, the figure transformed before his eyes into "
                 'that of Dr. Henry Jekyll. Lanyon closes his letter by '
                 'pointing out that the man who stepped into the house that '
                 "night to claim Jekyll's items was the man known as Edward "
                 'Hyde. The final Chapter gives a fully detailed narration of '
                 "Dr. Jekyll's double life. Jekyll had been born wealthy and "
                 'had grown up handsome, honorable, and distinguished, and '
                 'yet, he committed secret acts of which he was thoroughly '
                 'ashamed; intellectually, he evaluated the differences '
                 'between his private life and his public life and, '
                 'ultimately, he became obsessed with the idea that at least '
                 'two different entities, or perhaps even more, occupy a '
                 "person's body. His reflections and his scientific knowledge "
                 'led him to contemplate the possibility of scientifically '
                 'isolating these two separate components. With this in mind, '
                 'he began to experiment with various chemical combinations. '
                 'Having ultimately compounded a certain mixture, he then '
                 'drank it, and his body, under great pain, was transformed '
                 'into an ugly, repugnant, repulsive "being," representing the '
                 '"pure evil" that existed within him. Afterward, by drinking '
                 'the same potion, he could then be transformed back into his '
                 'original self. His evil self became Edward Hyde, and in this '
                 'disguise, he was able to practice whatever shameful '
                 'depravities he wished, without feeling the shame that Dr. '
                 'Jekyll would feel. Recognizing his two "selves," Jekyll felt '
                 'the need of providing for, and protecting, Edward Hyde. '
                 'Therefore, he furnished a house in Soho, hired a discreet '
                 'and unscrupulous housekeeper, and announced to his servants '
                 'that Mr. Hyde was to have full access and liberty of '
                 "Jekyll's residence and, finally, he drew up a will leaving "
                 'all of his inheritance to Edward Hyde. Thus, this double '
                 'life continued until the murder of Sir Danvers Carew by '
                 'Edward Hyde. This horrible revelation caused Jekyll to make '
                 'a serious attempt to cast off his evil side — that is, '
                 'Edward Hyde — and for some time, he sought out the '
                 'companionship of his old friends. However, the Edward Hyde '
                 'side of his nature kept struggling to be recognized, and one '
                 "sunny day while sitting in Regent's Park, he was suddenly "
                 'transformed into Edward Hyde. It was at this time that he '
                 'sought the help of his friend Dr. Lanyon. He hid in a hotel '
                 'and wrote a letter asking Dr. Lanyon to go to the laboratory '
                 "in his house and fetch certain drugs to Lanyon's house. "
                 "There, Hyde drank the potion described in Lanyon's letter. "
                 'The drug caused him to change to Dr. Jekyll, while Dr. '
                 'Lanyon watched the transformation in utter horror. After '
                 "awhile, Edward Hyde almost totally occupied Jekyll's nature, "
                 'and the original drug was no longer effective to return Hyde '
                 'to Jekyll. After having Poole search throughout London for '
                 'the necessary "powder," Jekyll realized that his original '
                 'compound must have possessed some impurity which cannot now '
                 'be duplicated. In despair at being forced to live the rest '
                 'of his life as Hyde, he commits suicide at the moment that '
                 'Utterson and Poole are breaking down the laboratory door.',

{'author': 'Bram Stoker',
 'book_title': 'Dracula',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Sometime in the late nineteenth century, Jonathan Harker, a '
                 'young English lawyer, is traveling to the Castle Dracula, '
                 'which is located in Transylvania, in order to finalize a '
                 'transfer of real estate in England to Count Dracula. Harker '
                 'becomes extremely nervous when all of the local peasants '
                 'react in fear after they hear of his destination; '
                 'nevertheless, he continues on to the castle until he meets '
                 'an emissary of the Count in the Borgo Pass. The mysterious '
                 'coach driver continues on to the castle, arriving in pitch '
                 'darkness, to the accompaniment of howling wolves. Even '
                 'though his accomodations are comfortable, Harker finds Count '
                 'Dracula to be a pale, gaunt, thin man, rather strange, and '
                 'Harker is mortified when, after accidentally cutting himself '
                 'shaving, the Count lunges at Harker\'s throat in "demoniac '
                 'fury." Harker soon finds himself imprisoned within the '
                 'castle and assailed by three seductive female vampires, whom '
                 "he can barely stave off. Harker also discovers the Count's "
                 'secret — that is, the Count survives by drinking the blood '
                 'of human beings — and, now, he is intent on killing Harker. '
                 "The Count escapes Jonathan's attempt to kill him, and he "
                 'swiftly leaves the castle with fifty boxes of earth, bound '
                 'for England. The last we hear of Jonathan Harker, he is weak '
                 'and sick, left alone with no visible means of escape from '
                 "the castle. The novel then shifts to England, where Harker's "
                 'fiancée, Mina Murray, is visiting her friend Lucy Westenra, '
                 'who has accepted the marriage proposal of Arthur Holmwood, '
                 'while rejecting the proposals of Dr. John Seward, head of a '
                 'lunatic asylum, and Quincey Morris, an American from Texas, '
                 "currently visiting Holmwood. Mina's two main concerns are "
                 'that Lucy has taken up her old habit of sleepwalking, and '
                 'that it is a long time since she has heard from her own '
                 'fiancé, Jonathan. One night while the two women are out '
                 'walking, they witness the approach of a strange ship. When '
                 'the ship is wrecked on the beach, the only creature which '
                 'survives is a huge dog, which quickly disappears. We soon '
                 'discover that the wrecked ship is carrying fifty boxes of '
                 'earth from the Castle Dracula. Soon after the shipwreck, '
                 'late one night, Mina discovers that Lucy is sleepwalking '
                 "again. In her search, Mina discovers Lucy on the ladies' "
                 'favorite seat, near the graveyard overlooking the town. Mina '
                 'is shocked to see hovering over Lucy a tall, thin, black '
                 "shape, but when she arrives at Lucy's side the shape has "
                 'disappeared. When awakened, Lucy remembers nothing of what '
                 'has happened, except that she is chilled. In wrapping Lucy '
                 'against the cold, Mina assumes that she inadvertently '
                 'pricked Lucy with a pin, for she sees two tiny red marks on '
                 "Lucy's neck. On later, successive nights, Lucy is often "
                 "found standing at the women's bedroom window; next to her is "
                 'a creature which appears to be a large bird, but it is, in '
                 "fact, a bat. Lucy's health declines over the next few weeks, "
                 "and because of this Mina refuses to tell Lucy about Lucy's "
                 "mother's sickness. Meanwhile, Dr. Seward, Lucy's former "
                 "suitor, is unable to ascertain the cause of Lucy's decline. "
                 'Soon, Mina hears from Jonathan, and so she leaves Lucy and '
                 "goes to nurse him. Almost immediately, Lucy's condition "
                 'deteriorates, and Dr. Seward finds it necessary to wire for '
                 'his old friend and mentor, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, who '
                 'offers another medical opinion. Van Helsing is particularly '
                 "disturbed by the two tiny spots on Lucy's throat and her "
                 'apparent but unexplainable loss of blood since there are no '
                 'signs of hemorrhage. It becomes necessary to give Lucy '
                 'numerous blood transfusions, and after each one she improves '
                 'significantly, only to deteriorate quickly in the next '
                 'couple of days. Van Helsing finally deems it necessary to '
                 "drape Lucy's room, as well as her neck, with garlic, a "
                 'technique, we learn later, which is used to ward off '
                 'vampires. Eventually, however, the vampire manages to evade '
                 'the spells against him, and he attacks Lucy again. One '
                 'significant night, an escaped wolf is used to smash the '
                 "window of Lucy's room. The wolf's attack so frightens Lucy's "
                 'mother that she dies of shock, and Lucy, left helpless, is '
                 'again attacked by the vampire. Van Helsing, knowing that '
                 'Lucy is near death, summons her fiancé, Arthur Holmwood, to '
                 'her side. Holmwood himself comes from the deathbed of his '
                 'father. As Holmwood bends to kiss Lucy goodbye, Lucy, whose '
                 'canine teeth have become strangely lengthened, attempts to '
                 'attack Arthur. As Van Helsing throws Arthur back from her, '
                 "Lucy dies. After Lucy's death, the papers report the strange "
                 'appearance of a person whom the village children label as '
                 '"the Bloofer Lady," a creature who has been attacking young '
                 'children in the area. Van Helsing, shaken by the reports, '
                 "summons Dr. Seward to attend him in an examination of Lucy's "
                 "coffin. After Seward's initial shock, he agrees, albeit with "
                 "reservations, to open Lucy's coffin. In the meantime, Mina "
                 'and Jonathan have been married, and they return to England. '
                 "Mina has transcribed Jonathan's diary of his journey in "
                 'Transylvania, and soon afterward Van Helsing reads it. Van '
                 "Helsing then calls all of Lucy's ex-suitors together, and he "
                 'explains to them his belief that Lucy has been bitten by a '
                 'vampire and has become one herself. The only way to save her '
                 'soul, he says, is to drive a wooden stake through her heart, '
                 'cut off her head and stuff it with garlic. Eventually Van '
                 'Helsing convinces them of the truth of his claims, and the '
                 '"service" is performed on Lucy. Now the protagonists begin a '
                 'search for the Count and also for the fifty boxes of earth '
                 'which he brought with him to England; these six people — '
                 'Jonathan, Mina, Dr. Seward, Van Helsing, Holmwood, and '
                 'Quincey Morris — vow to confront the vampire. Soon after the '
                 'search begins, Van Helsing realizes that a dreadful change '
                 'is taking place in Mina. One horrific night, Van Helsing and '
                 "Seward break into Mina's room, find Jonathan unconscious, "
                 'and Mina being forced to suck blood from a deep slash across '
                 "Dracula's chest. In a twinkling, Dracula disappears. They "
                 'finally discover and destroy all of the fifty boxes except '
                 'one, which they learn has been sent by ship back to '
                 "Dracula's castle. Using various methods, including the "
                 'hypnosis of Mina, they follow Dracula all the way to the '
                 'Borgo Pass in Transylvania, where they find the last '
                 'remaining box being transported to Castle Dracula by a group '
                 'of gypsies. They overcome the gypsies, throw the box to the '
                 'ground, tear open its lid, and discover the body of the '
                 "Count. With a huge thrust, Jonathan cuts off the vampire's "
                 "head, while Morris drives his knife into the Count's heart. "
                 'The Count himself crumbles into dust, and Quincey Morris, '
                 'having been wounded by the gypsies in an attempt to retrieve '
                 'the box, dies of a mortal wound, and so the novel ends.',

 'summary_text': 'The basic storyline of A Dream of Red Mansions focuses '
                 'primarily on the Chia family. There are two dukes in the '
                 'family — Duke Ning-kuo and Duke Jung-kuo. Chia Fu, the elder '
                 'grandson of Duke Ning-kuo, dies young, so the second '
                 'grandson, Chia Ching, succeeds to the title after the death '
                 'of his father, Chia Tai-hua. However, since his heart is set '
                 'on a religious life, he relinquishes his title to his son, '
                 'Chia Chen, and devotes his time and energy to religious '
                 'study, hoping to become an immortal after death. Unlike his '
                 'father, Chia Chen is a libertine, indulging himself in a '
                 'lecherous lifestyle. For example, he has an illicit affair '
                 "with his son's wife, Chin Ko-ching. Duke Jung-kuo's son Chia "
                 'Tai-shan marries the daughter of Marquis Shih of Chinling '
                 '(Duchess Chia née Shih, Lady Dowager). They have two sons, '
                 'Chia Sheh and Chia Cheng, and a daughter, Chia Min. Chia '
                 'Sheh has a son, Chia Lien, whose wife is Wang Hsi-feng , and '
                 'their daughter is Chiao-chieh. Chia Sheh has a daughter, '
                 'Ying-chun, by a concubine. Chia Cheng marries Lady Wang, and '
                 'they have two sons, Chia Chu and Chia Pao-yu, and a '
                 'daughter, Tan-chun (by concubine Lady Chao). Chia Chu dies '
                 'young, leaving his wife, Li Wan, and his son, Chia Lan, '
                 'behind. Chia Pao-yu is born with a piece of precious jade in '
                 'his mouth — the Jade of Spiritual Understanding. Chia Min is '
                 'married to Lin Ju-hai, but dies young, leaving a daughter, '
                 'Lin Tai-yu, with her father, Lin Juhai. Upon her grandmother '
                 "Lady Dowager's invitation, Tai-yu comes to live with the "
                 'Chia family. Lady Dowager dotes on both Pao-yu and Tai-yu. '
                 'As the Chia family is a wealthy and powerful, aristocratic '
                 'family and the household is a vast one, Aunt Hsueh and her '
                 'daughter, Hsueh Pao-chai, come to join the household. '
                 'Pao-yu, in his innocent and naive fashion, loves both girls '
                 'equally, although his strongest attachment is to Tai-yu. '
                 "When Pao-yu's sister Yuan-chun is chosen as an Imperial "
                 'concubine (Imperial Consort), the Chia family grows even '
                 'more affluent and influential. They build Grand View Garden '
                 '(Ta-kuan Garden) to honor and entertain Yuan-chun when she '
                 'comes back for a visit; it is a vast, beautiful setting '
                 'where the whole family can dine together in great happiness. '
                 'Pao-yu clearly has a preference for feminine company and '
                 'spends most of his time with his girl cousins and young '
                 'maid-servants, such as Hsi-jen, Chin-wen, Tzu-chuan, and '
                 'Hsueh-yen. Not surprisingly, his father, Chia Cheng, is very '
                 'strict with him and often criticizes him for spending so '
                 'much time with the girls instead of studying the classic '
                 'works that he will be tested on during the all-important '
                 'official examination. Pao-yu, however, is a rebellious '
                 "character. Contrary to feudal ethics, he isn't interested in "
                 'an official career. What he cares for most is playing freely '
                 'with innocent girls and writing poems while yearning for the '
                 'freedom to love and marry whomever he chooses. Because of '
                 'the concept of feudal fatalism, the Chia authorities — '
                 'represented by Lady Dowager, Chia Cheng, Lady Wang, and Wang '
                 "Hsi-feng — decide to choose Pao-chai as Pao-yu's bride — "
                 'instead of the lovely, but sickly (and rebellious) Tai-yu. '
                 'In their opinion, Pao-yu and Pao-chai are a perfect couple. '
                 'Their marriage will be a symbolic union between a "precious '
                 'jade" and a golden locket." Therefore, when they become '
                 'aware of the fact that Pao-yu deeply loves Tai-yu, they '
                 'decide to play a cruel trick on him. They tell him that he '
                 'will be married to Lin Tai-yu; secretly, though, they plan '
                 'to have him marry the heavily veiled Pao-chai. '
                 'Unfortunately, the secret is leaked to Tai-yu, and she falls '
                 "unconscious and begins spitting blood. On Pao-yu's wedding "
                 'day, Lin Tai-yu is left alone — sick in bed, accompanied '
                 'only by Tzu-chuan. She breathes her last in loneliness, '
                 'grief, and hatred, while Pao-yu goes merrily to the wedding '
                 'ceremony, assuming that his bride will be Lin Tai-yu. When '
                 'he finds himself married to Hsueh Pao-chai, he goes out of '
                 'his mind. Meanwhile, the Imperial concubine dies and Chia '
                 'Sheh is deprived of his rank for conspiring with provincial '
                 'officials to take advantage of the weak. His properties are '
                 'confiscated, and the house of Chia Cheng is involved. The '
                 'grandmother dies, the nun Miao-yu is kidnapped, Wang '
                 'Hsi-feng loses authority and dies in regret and with a '
                 "guilty conscience. Pao-yu's illness grows worse until he is "
                 'on the point of death — when suddenly a monk appears with '
                 "Pao-yu's lost jade. Momentarily, Pao-yu seems to be himself "
                 'again, but suddenly he faints away again at the sight of the '
                 'monk and regains consciousness only after a terrible '
                 'nightmare. Pao-yu then changes his ways and determines to '
                 'restore the reputation of his house. The following day, he '
                 'takes the official examination, placing seventh on the list. '
                 "Pao-yu's wife, Pao-chai, is pregnant, but nonetheless, he "
                 'suddenly decides to leave her and disappears after the '
                 'examination. Chin Cheng, on his way back to Peking after '
                 "attending his mother's funeral in Nanking, stays at Piling "
                 'Station one snowy night, and there he sees a man with a '
                 'shaved head, bare feet, and wearing a red woolen cape. The '
                 'man bows to him and, on close inspection, he recognizes '
                 'Pao-yu. Before Chia Cheng can speak to him, though, a '
                 'Buddhist monk and a Taoist take Pao-yu away. Chia Cheng runs '
                 'after them, but they have vanished, and all he can see is a '
                 'stretch of snowy waste. That is the main thread of the '
                 'story. The narrative itself is based on the prediction in '
                 "Pao-yu's dream, years ago, when Pao-yu found himself in a "
                 'fairyland, where he met a goddess and was shown the register '
                 'of the Twelve Beauties of Chinling. He saw pictures and '
                 'poems which he could not understand. The Goddess ordered her '
                 'maids to sing twelve songs, the last of which runs as '
                 "follows: The high official's fortunes will decline; the rich "
                 "man's gold and silver will melt away; the kind of heart will "
                 'escape death; the heartless will receive their just deserts; '
                 'he who takes life will pay with his own life; he who causes '
                 'tears will weep till his eyes are dry; one who sees through '
                 'this world will enter holy orders; one enslaved by love will '
                 'die a fruitless death; when all food is gone, birds will fly '
                 'to the woods, leaving nothing but bare, naked earth behind. '
                 'The story line of the novel roughly parallels these '
                 'predictions. The outward magnificence of the Chia family '
                 'cannot disguise its decline and deterioration forever. The '
                 'Chia family members are accustomed to living in luxury, and '
                 'certain parasitic landowners (such as Chin Sheh and Chin '
                 'Chen) are nothing but dissolute and dissipated people. In '
                 'order to enjoy a life of extravagance, they put increasing '
                 'pressure on the peasants and extract heavy taxes from their '
                 'tenants. Relying on their wealth and political influence, '
                 'they bully innocent citizens and maids (such as Hsueh Pan '
                 'and Wang Hsi-feng ) by contemptible and cruel methods. '
                 "Therefore, tragedy begins to overshadow the family's "
                 'splendor. There are many conflicts undermining the network '
                 'of this enormous household — conflicts between masters and '
                 'servants, between wives and concubines, between lineal '
                 'descendants and sons and daughters by concubines. All these '
                 'internal struggles lead to plotting against each other and '
                 "several suicides. Chin Ko-ching hangs herself; Pao-yu's good "
                 'friend Chin Chung dies young; the maid Chin-chuan drowns '
                 'herself in a well; Second Sister Yu commits suicide by '
                 "swallowing gold; Pao-yu's favorite maid, Chin-wen, dies soon "
                 "after being dismissed because of Lady Wang's prejudice "
                 'against her. Even Pao-yu himself comes under an evil '
                 'influence and is the target of an assassination plot by Lady '
                 "Chao and her son, Chin Huan. Granny Liu's visits to the Chin "
                 'family bear convincing witness to the hypocrisy of the '
                 'landlord class and their extravagance. Her simple and poor '
                 'lifestyle stands in sharp contrast to their luxurious way of '
                 "life. The Chia family's arbitrariness towards ordinary "
                 "people and servants leads to Ho San's collusion with "
                 'brigands to rob Lady Dowager of her gold and silver so that '
                 "the Chia family's decline is accelerated. Chia Sheh's "
                 "treachery and Chia Chen's lechery result in the confiscation "
                 "of the family property. Finally, however, the Emperor's "
                 'general amnesty pardons Chia Sheh and Chia Chen, Chia Cheng '
                 'is allowed to return to his original position, and the '
                 'confiscated property is restored.',

                 'Deerslayer and to Hurry Harry. Suspicious at first of '
                 'Deerslayer, Tom Hutter, or Floating Tom, realizes that the '
                 'newcomer will be a valuable ally in case of Indian attack. '
                 'As the ark is maneuvered away from shore to the open lake, '
                 'some Mingos try to board the vessel; but Deerslayer proves '
                 'his worth by repulsing the invasion. The three men decide to '
                 'reclaim the canoes hidden by Tom Hutter along the shores of '
                 'Glimmerglass. Having succeeded in this mission for their '
                 'protection and defense, Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry scheme to '
                 'land in the dark, attack the sleeping Mingo women and '
                 'children, and get scalps for the bounties. Although '
                 'Deerslayer refuses to join this expedition, he waits '
                 'offshore in a canoe for the return of Hurry Harry and '
                 'Floating Tom. The Mingos are not so easily deceived, and the '
                 'two white men are captured. Unable to help the prisoners, '
                 'Deerslayer determines to secure the canoes first and to '
                 'return to the ark where the girls are waiting. One canoe '
                 'drifts to the shore, and Deerslayer, trying to recover the '
                 'boat, is met by a Mingo who also claims the canoe. Thinking '
                 'that he has persuaded the Indian of the true ownership of '
                 'the boat, Deerslayer turns away. In time, Deerslayer sees '
                 'the Mingo preparing to shoot, and he fatally wounds the '
                 'attacking Indian. Deerslayer, having experienced his "first '
                 'warpath," treats his dying opponent honorably by not taking '
                 'his scalp and by arranging him comfortably. The Mingos, '
                 'recognizing in Natty Bumppo a great warrior, call him by a '
                 'new nickname — Hawkeye. At the ark, Deerslayer prepares to '
                 'meet his friend Chingachgook, a chief of the Delaware '
                 'nation. The rendezvous is perilous because the Mingos are '
                 'pursuing Chingachgook. He jumps aboard the ark and barely '
                 'escapes. While the friends rejoice in their reunion, Hetty '
                 'surprises everyone by her decision to leave alone in a '
                 'canoe, go to the Indians and try to convince the savages to '
                 'release the two prisoners. Although Deerslayer tries to '
                 'block her path with another canoe, Hetty eludes him and '
                 'refuses to listen to his warnings. Hetty, stumbling through '
                 'the woods, meets Hist, who has been abducted by a renegade '
                 'Delaware and brought to the Mingo camp. Hist is in love with '
                 'Chingachgook and explains to Hetty that the Delaware chief '
                 'and Deerslayer have met at Glimmerglass to rescue her. '
                 "Although the Mingos refuse to listen to Hetty's pleas to "
                 'release Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry, they do not harm the '
                 'girl because they respect as blessed by divine protection a '
                 'person of limited intelligence and simple-mindedness, such '
                 "as Hetty. Deerslayer and Judith open Tom Hutter's chest to "
                 'find any items they can use as ransom for the two white men. '
                 'The three exiles on the ark, intent on their investigation '
                 'of the chest, are startled by the appearance of a Mingo who '
                 'serves as a guide for the returning Hetty. Deerslayer shows '
                 'some ivory chess pieces to the Indian who eagerly goes back '
                 'to the Mingo camp with this news of a possible exchange of '
                 'the pawns for the prisoners. After hard bargaining, '
                 'Rivenoak, the Mingo chief who has approached the ark, '
                 'accepts the ivory rooks, and Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry are '
                 'set free. Learning nothing from their close call with death, '
                 'the two men plot another raid for scalps on the Indian camp. '
                 'They discover, however, that the Indians have moved camp, '
                 'spoiling their plans. Setting out to rescue Hist, Deerslayer '
                 'and Chingachgook are dismayed to find that the new Mingo '
                 'camp is at the place where the Indian girl told Hetty she '
                 'would be waiting. Despite the increased danger, Deerslayer '
                 'and Chingachgook plot to save Hist. In the ensuing action, '
                 'Deerslayer is able to shove the canoe with Chingachgook and '
                 'Hist beyond range of the Mingos, but he is pursued by the '
                 'Indians and captured. Hetty is sent by Judith to the Mingos, '
                 'but they refuse to bargain for such an important prisoner. '
                 "Judith and Hetty, after the latter's return from her "
                 'unsuccessful mission to ransom Deerslayer, travel in their '
                 'canoe around Glimmerglass in search of the ark. A shot fired '
                 'by Hurry Harry from the ark accidentally kills an Indian '
                 'maiden who was meeting her lover on the shore. On the ark, '
                 'the four refugees (Tom Hutter, Hurry Harry, Chingachgook, '
                 'and Hist) go to Muskrat Castle where the white men, ignoring '
                 'the warnings of their two Indian companions about a possible '
                 'ambush, enter fearlessly. The Mingos, hiding in the castle, '
                 'attack, subdue, and tie up Tom Hutter and Hurry Harry. '
                 'Chingachgook and Hist, helpless onlookers on the ark, '
                 'maneuver the boat out of range; and Hurry Harry quickly '
                 "rolls off the castle's platform into the lake where he is "
                 'pulled to safety. The Mingos at first pursue the ark in a '
                 'canoe, but they see a better target: Judith and Hetty in '
                 'another canoe. After a chase which the Mingos almost win, '
                 'one of the Indians breaks a paddle and they give up the '
                 'pursuit. When the two girls go to Muskrat Castle, they find '
                 'that Tom Hutter, scalped by the Mingos, is close to death. '
                 "After confessing that he is not Judith and Hetty's father, "
                 'Tom Hutter dies and is buried in Glimmerglass, close to the '
                 "watery grave of his wife, the girls' mother. Deerslayer, "
                 'released temporarily by the Mingos, appears and announces '
                 'the terms of surrender from the Indians: Chingachgook is to '
                 'leave in safety, the three girls are to live with the tribe. '
                 "The offers are quickly rejected to Deerslayer's joy. Hurry "
                 'Harry, rejected for the last time by Judith, is taken ashore '
                 'by Deerslayer with the plea that he should try to reach the '
                 'garrison of soldiers nearby. Deerslayer and Judith open Tom '
                 "Hutter's chest on the ark, and letters confirm that he was a "
                 "pirate. After endeavoring to win Deerslayer's love with her "
                 'frank admission of love for him, Judith realizes that he '
                 'will not sacrifice his code and his honor and that he will '
                 'return to the Indian camp for torture and death. Deerslayer '
                 'bids farewell on the following morning to his friends '
                 '(Chingachgook, Hist, Judith, and Hetty) and gives them his '
                 'final counsel. Chingachgook and he engage in a shooting '
                 "match with Killdeer, Tom Hutter's rifle given by Judith to "
                 "Deerslayer, and, after Deerslayer's (expected) death, to "
                 'Chingachgook. The Mingos are surprised by his honorable '
                 'return to his sentence of condemnation. Rivenoak, the chief, '
                 'asks Deerslayer to join the tribe, but is refused. '
                 'Deerslayer also refuses to marry the widow of the Mingo he '
                 'killed on his "first warpath." The trial begins with the '
                 'throwing of knives and tomahawks to unnerve Deerslayer; but '
                 'he succeeds in seizing one tomahawk, hurling it back at his '
                 'assailant, and making his escape. Recaptured by the Mingos '
                 'because the current brought his canoe back to shore, '
                 'Deerslayer is now tortured by rifle shots fired close to him '
                 'at the stake and by a fire built at his feet. Judith appears '
                 'elegantly dressed, claims she is an important lady with '
                 "soldiers, and demands Deerslayer's release. Hetty, confused "
                 "by the events, tells Rivenoak Judith's true identity. "
                 'Chingachgook and Hist appear individually to challenge the '
                 'Mingos, but they likewise fail. With all their enemies in '
                 'hand, the Mingos are triumphant until soldiers from the '
                 'garrison, guided by Hurry Harry and the shots fired by '
                 'Deerslayer and Chingachgook on the ark, surprise the Indians '
                 'and kill most of them. Hetty has been mortally wounded, and '
                 'her death saddens all the survivors. After a last plea to '
                 'Deerslayer to marry her, Judith goes back to the garrison '
                 'with the soldiers. Deerslayer, Chingachgook, and Hist return '
                 'to the Delaware territory. Fifteen years later, Deerslayer '
                 "and Chingachgook return to Glimmerglass with the latter's "
                 'son, Uncas, and contemplate the great adventure.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'At the age of thirty-five, on the night of Good Friday in '
                 'the year 1300, Dante finds himself lost in a dark wood and '
                 'full of fear. He sees a sun-drenched mountain in the '
                 'distance, and he tries to climb it, but three beasts, a '
                 'leopard, a lion, and a she-wolf, stand in his way. Dante is '
                 'forced to return to the forest where he meets the spirit of '
                 'Virgil, who promises to lead him on a journey through Hell '
                 'so that he may be able to enter Paradise. Dante agrees to '
                 'the journey and follows Virgil through the gates of Hell. '
                 'The two poets enter the vestibule of Hell where the souls of '
                 'the uncommitted are tormented by biting insects and damned '
                 'to chase a blank banner around for eternity. The poets reach '
                 'the banks of the river Acheron where souls await passage '
                 'into Hell proper. The ferryman, Charon, reluctantly agrees '
                 'to take the poets across the river to Limbo, the first '
                 'circle of Hell, where Virgil permanently resides. In Limbo, '
                 'the poets stop to speak with other great poets, Homer, Ovid, '
                 'Horace, and Lucan, and then enter a great citadel where '
                 'philosophers reside. Dante and Virgil enter Hell proper, the '
                 'second circle, where monster, Minos, sits in judgment of all '
                 'of the damned, and sends them to the proper circle according '
                 'to their sin. Here, Dante meets Paolo and Francesca, the two '
                 'unfaithful lovers buffeted about in a windy storm. The poets '
                 'move on to the third circle, the Gluttons, who are guarded '
                 'by the monster Cerberus. These sinners spend eternity '
                 'wallowing in mud and mire, and here Dante recognizes a '
                 'Florentine, Ciacco, who gives Dante the first of many '
                 'negative prophesies about him and Florence. Upon entering '
                 'the fourth circle, Dante and Virgil encounter the Hoarders '
                 'and the Wasters, who spend eternity rolling giant boulders '
                 'at one another. They move to the fifth circle, the marsh '
                 'comprising the river Styx, where Dante is accosted by a '
                 'Florentine, Filippo Argenti; he is amongst the Wrathful that '
                 'fight and battle one another in the mire of the Styx. The '
                 'city of Dis begins Circle VI, the realm of the violent. The '
                 'poets enter and find themselves in Circle VI, realm of the '
                 'Heretics, who reside among the thousands in burning tombs. '
                 'Dante stops to speak with two sinners, Farinata degli '
                 "Uberti, Dante's Ghibelline enemy, and Cavalcante dei "
                 "Cavalcanti, father of Dante's poet friend, Guido. The poets "
                 'then begin descending through a deep valley. Here, they meet '
                 'the Minotaur and see a river of boiling blood, the '
                 'Phlegethon, where those violent against their neighbors, '
                 'tyrants, and war-makers reside, each in a depth according to '
                 'their sin. Virgil arranges for the Centaur, Nessus, to take '
                 'them across the river into the second round of circle seven, '
                 'the Suicides. Here Dante speaks with the soul of Pier delle '
                 'Vigne and learns his sad tale. In the third round of Circle '
                 'VII, a desert wasteland awash in a rain of burning '
                 'snowflakes, Dante recognizes and speaks with Capaneus, a '
                 'famous blasphemer. He also speaks to his beloved advisor and '
                 'scholar, Brunetto Latini. This is the round held for the '
                 'Blasphemers, Sodomites, and the Usurers. The poets then '
                 'enter Circle VIII, which contains ten chasms, or ditches. '
                 'The first chasm houses the Panderers and the Seducers who '
                 'spend eternity lashed by whips. The second chasm houses the '
                 'Flatterers, who reside in a channel of excrement. The third '
                 'chasm houses the Simonists, who are plunged upside-down in '
                 'baptismal fonts with the soles of their feet on fire. Dante '
                 'speaks with Pope Nicholas, who mistakes him for Pope '
                 'Boniface. In the fourth chasm, Dante sees the Fortune '
                 'Tellers and Diviners, who spend eternity with their heads on '
                 'backwards and their eyes clouded by tears. At the fifth '
                 'chasm, the poets see the sinners of Graft plunged deeply '
                 'into a river of boiling pitch and slashed at by demons. At '
                 'the sixth chasm, the poets encounter the Hypocrites, mainly '
                 'religious men damned to walk endlessly in a circle wearing '
                 'glittering leaden robes. The chief sinner here, Caiaphas, is '
                 'crucified on the ground, and all of the other sinners must '
                 'step on him to pass. Two Jovial friars tell the poets the '
                 'way to the seventh ditch, where the Thieves have their hands '
                 'cut off and spend eternity among vipers that transform them '
                 'into serpents by biting them. They, in turn, must bite '
                 'another sinner to take back a human form. At the eighth '
                 'chasm Dante sees many flames that conceal the souls of the '
                 'Evil Counselors. Dante speaks to Ulysses, who gives him an '
                 'account of his death. At the ninth chasm, the poets see a '
                 'mass of horribly mutilated bodies. They were the sowers of '
                 'discord, such as Mahomet. They are walking in a circle. By '
                 'the time they come around the circle, their wounds knit, '
                 'only to be opened again and again. They arrive at the tenth '
                 'chasm the Falsifiers. Here they see the sinners afflicted '
                 'with terrible plagues, some unable to move, some picking '
                 'scabs off of one another. They arrive at the ninth circle. '
                 'It is comprised of a giant frozen lake, Cocytus, in which '
                 'the sinners are stuck. Dante believes that he sees towers in '
                 'the distance, which turn out to be the Giants. One of the '
                 'Giants, Antaeus, takes the poets on his palm and gently '
                 'places them at the bottom of the well. Circle IX is composed '
                 'of four rounds, each housing sinners, according to the '
                 'severity of their sin. In the first round, Caina, the '
                 'sinners are frozen up to their necks in ice. In the second '
                 'round, Antenora, the sinners are frozen closer to their '
                 'heads. Here, Dante accidentally kicks a traitor in the head, '
                 'and when the traitor will not tell him his name, Dante '
                 'treats him savagely. Dante hears the terrible story of Count '
                 'Ugolino, who is gnawing the head and neck of Archbishop '
                 "Ruggieri, due to Ruggieri's treacherous treatment of him in "
                 'the upper world. In the third round, Ptolomea, where the '
                 'Traitors to Guests reside, Dante speaks with a soul who begs '
                 'him to take the ice visors, formed from tears, out of his '
                 'eyes. Dante promises to do so, but after hearing his story '
                 'refuses. The fourth round of Circle IX, and the very final '

 'summary_text': 'Youthful Emma Woodhouse, whose long-time governess and '
                 'friend Miss Taylor has just married Mr. Weston, takes some '
                 'solace in being left alone with her aging father by claiming '
                 'that she made the match herself. An old friend of the '
                 'family, Mr. George Knightley, does not believe her, but in '
                 'her certainty she decides that she must also marry off the '
                 'young rector, Mr. Elton. Among her friends and acquaintances '
                 'in the large and populous village of Highbury, she begins to '
                 'notice young Harriet Smith, the pretty illegitimate '
                 "seventeen-year-old who lives at Mrs. Goddard's boarding "
                 'school. Determining first to improve Harriet, Emma '
                 'discourages her interest in worthy Robert Martin of '
                 'Abbey-Mill Farm, declares that Harriet must be from more '
                 'genteel parents than his, and fixes upon Harriet as Mr. '
                 "Elton's future wife. In bringing the two together socially, "
                 'Emma does a drawing of Harriet which Mr. Elton admires and '
                 'takes off to London to be framed. This appears so promising '
                 'to Emma that, when Harriet receives a letter of proposal '
                 'from Robert Martin, Emma discredits him and actually helps '
                 'Harriet write a letter of refusal in spite of the fact that '
                 'Mr. Knightley has nothing but respect for Robert. Ensuing '
                 'events convince Emma that Harriet and Mr. Elton are '
                 'developing a mutual regard, and she takes pride in the '
                 'apparent success of her endeavor, at the same time affirming '
                 'that she herself will never marry. For the Christmas '
                 'holidays Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, respectively the '
                 'brother of George Knightley and the sister of Emma, come '
                 'from London with their five children to visit the '
                 'Woodhouses. On December 24, which proves to be a bad day of '
                 'snow, all of them, including George Knightley and Mr. Elton, '
                 'go for a dinner with the Westons. There discussion turns to '
                 "Frank Churchill, Weston's handsome, polished son by a former "
                 "marriage (Frank had taken his uncle's name upon going to "
                 'live with him) but a son who has never been seen in '
                 'Highbury. John Knightley in particular thinks it oddly '
                 'improper that Frank has not yet called on his newly '
                 'remarried father, even though Frank lives some distance away '
                 'in Yorkshire with the Churchills. There have been letters '
                 'from him, of course, and a pleasant surprise of the dinner '
                 'party is an announcement that a recent letter says that '
                 'Frank will be coming for a visit within a fortnight, an '
                 'announcement that reminds Emma that, if she were ever to '
                 'marry, Frank would suit her in age, character, and '
                 'condition. The snow increases to the point that the visitors '
                 'feel that they must go if they are to reach home safely. To '
                 'her consternation Emma finds herself alone with Mr. Elton in '
                 'the second carriage. But she is disconcerted even more when '
                 'he begins insistently to declare his love for her and when '
                 'he is amazed to learn that she thought him in love with '
                 "Harriet. Emma's refusal of Mr. Elton's offer is firm, but "
                 'she is indeed worried that he has never thought seriously of '
                 'Harriet. Her worry and self-criticism continue through the '
                 'night, mixed with resentment at the impertinence of Mr. '
                 "Elton's aspirations toward herself. Fortunately for her, "
                 'during the next few days everyone is confined to home by the '
                 'weather. On the first good day, the John Knightleys return '
                 'to London while Mr. Elton informs Mr. Woodhouse in a note '
                 "that he is leaving for a visit to Bath: It is Emma's unhappy "
                 'duty to inform Harriet about Mr. Elton and to console her, '
                 'inwardly blaming herself for being in error. In addition to '
                 'this disappointment in her plans, she learns that Frank '
                 'Churchill has once again had to defer his visit because Mrs. '
                 'Churchill is ill, a condition that many of Highbury doubt. '
                 "George Knightley in particular questions Frank's real sense "
                 'of duty toward Mr. Weston and, in a conversation with Emma, '
                 "indicates that he does not share Highbury's (and Emma's) "
                 'general tendency to think highly of the young man whom the '
                 'town has never yet seen. Though Miss Bates, as a harmless '
                 "but compulsive talker, is disagreeable in Emma's eyes, Emma "
                 'pays a duty call to her and Mrs. Bates and learns that Miss '
                 "Bates' orphan niece Jane Fairfax will arrive next week for a "
                 'two-months visit. Jane upon arrival is elegant, '
                 'accomplished, and reserved, and Emma does not like her — '
                 'likes her even less, in fact, when she learns that Jane and '
                 'Frank Churchill had met at Weymouth. George Knightley is '
                 'about to tell Emma some news when Miss Bates and Jane arrive '
                 'to announce that Mr. Elton, still in Bath, has become '
                 'engaged to Augusta Hawkins there. Later Harriet comes to say '
                 'that she has encountered Robert Martin and his sister at '
                 "Ford's shop downtown, but Emma takes her mind off it by "
                 'relating the news about Mr. Elton. Frank Churchill finally '
                 'arrives and is very agreeable and lively. From the time of '
                 'his first visit to the Woodhouses, it is evident that Mr. '
                 'and Mrs. Weston would like to make a match between him and '
                 'Emma; but the call is ended by his going off to see the '
                 'Bateses and Jane Fairfax. On subsequent meetings Emma is won '
                 'over by Frank, and in their discussion of Jane and her '
                 'reserve Frank perfectly agrees with Emma. Faith in him is '
                 'shaken when he runs off to London just to get a haircut, but '
                 'he returns unabashed and continues to sparkle. At a party '
                 'given by the Coles, Frank sits attentively beside Emma. '
                 'Jane, it is learned, has received a new pianoforte. When '
                 "Emma hints that Mr. Dixon, the husband of Jane's friend in "
                 'Ireland, sent it, Frank politely agrees. Because of some '
                 'impromptu dancing at the Coles, Emma and Frank later plan a '
                 'dance at the Crown Inn, but everything is overthrown when '
                 "Frank has to leave owing to Mrs. Churchill's illness. Before "
                 'going, Frank visits the Bateses and then the Woodhouses, '
                 'leaving Emma pretty well convinced that he is in love with '
                 'her, though she can picture herself only as refusing him. '
                 'Emma now thinks she is in love with Frank, but his letters '
                 'to Mrs. Weston make Emma think also that she can do without '
                 'him. Meanwhile her attention is taken up with Harriet and '
                 'the arrival of Mrs. Augusta Elton, who has ease without '
                 'elegance, is vain and overly talkative, and proves to be an '
                 'insufferable organizer and "manager." Mr. Knightley shows '
                 'such respect for Jane Fairfax that Emma thinks he may be '
                 'falling in love, but he declares that he would never ask her '
                 'to marry him. At a dinner which Emma dutifully gives for the '
                 'Eltons, Jane discloses that she always fetches the mail from '
                 'the post office, and Mrs. Elton insists upon coming to her '
                 'general relief by finding a situation as governess for her. '
                 'But Jane, who is now to stay longer with the Bateses than '
                 'originally intended, says that she does not wish anything '
                 'attempted at the present. In the midst of things, Mr. Weston '
                 'arrives with the news that Frank will be with them again '
                 "soon because on doctor's orders Mrs. Churchill must come to "
                 'London for a stay in May. By the time Frank Churchill '
                 'returns, Emma realizes that there is no attachment on her '
                 'part. The ball at the Crown Inn now takes place. When '
                 'Harriet proves to have no dancing partner and Mr. Elton '
                 'obviously slights her, George Knightley, who has not danced '
                 'before, gallantly leads her to the set and afterward even '
                 'dances with Emma. The next day Frank rescues Harriet from '
                 'some gypsies, and Emma thinks she sees something developing '
                 'between them but decides not to interfere: It will be a mere '
                 'passive scheme. Harriet indicates that she is interested in '
                 'someone above her, and Emma is sure that it is Frank. During '
                 'a gathering at which they play a word game, Frank shoves '
                 'words at Jane which make George Knightley suspect that the '
                 'two are involved, but Emma will not believe him. In June a '
                 'strawberry party is held at Donwell Abbey, George '
                 "Knightley's estate. Emma observes George and Harriet walking "
                 'together. Frank does not arrive; Jane Fairfax leaves early '
                 'to walk home; and finally Frank arrives in agitation, not at '
                 'all his usual smooth self. The next day on an exploring '
                 'party to Box Hill, Emma and Frank flirt; Jane appears '
                 'bothered; and Emma is rude to Miss Bates. When Emma goes to '
                 'make amends the next morning, she learns that Jane has '
                 'accepted a position as governess and will be leaving soon. '
                 'Frank too has to leave, but immediately, for Mrs. Churchill '
                 "is ill and, in fact, soon dies. Emma feels sorry for Jane's "
                 'having to take a position, but her attentions are repulsed. '
                 'Ten days later the Westons receive a brief letter from Frank '
                 'in which he explains that he and Jane have been engaged '
                 'since their being together at Weymouth; Mr. Churchill now '
                 'gives his consent. It turns out that Harriet has not been '
                 'thinking of Frank at all but rather of George Knightley. '
                 'When Emma learns this, she is awakened to the fact that Mr. '
                 'Knightley must marry no one but herself and she wishes that '
                 'she had never seen Harriet and had let her marry Robert '
                 'Martin. Knightley returns from a business trip, learns the '
                 'news, and commiserates with Emma, who assures him that she '
                 'has never been captivated by Frank. The revelation leads '
                 'Knightley to declare his own feelings for Emma, and they '
                 'become engaged, though Emma knows that they cannot marry as '
                 'long as she has to take care of her father, for she cannot '
                 'leave him and he will not leave his home. A very reasonable '
                 'letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston explains satisfactorily his '
                 "conduct at Highbury and his and Jane's need for secrecy. "
                 'Emma is relieved, but she cannot set her mind at rest about '
                 'Harriet, who now goes to visit the John Knightleys in '
                 'London. Emma and Jane become reconciled as friends; George '
                 'Knightley decides that, since Emma cannot leave her father, '
                 'he will live with them; then it takes the combined '
                 'persuasive forces of Emma, Knightley, and the Westons to get '
                 'Mr. Woodhouse to agree to the marriage. When Harriet decides '
                 'to marry Robert Martin after all, Emma feels free enough '
                 'that, after some small delaying tactics by Mr. Woodhouse, '
                 'she and George Knightley are wed in "perfect happiness."',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Edith Wharton wrote Ethan Frome as a frame story — meaning '
                 'that the prologue and epilogue constitute a "frame" around '
                 'the main story. The "frame" is The Narrator\'s vision of the '
                 'tragedy that befalls Ethan Frome. The frame story takes '
                 'place nearly twenty years after the events of the main story '
                 'and is written in first person, revealing the thoughts and '
                 'feelings of The Narrator. The main story, which describes '
                 'the three and a half days before and including Ethan and '
                 "Mattie's sledding accident, is written in third person — an "
                 'omniscient narration that allows Wharton to relate the '
                 'thoughts and feelings of all the characters. Ethan Frome '
                 'begins when The Narrator, an engineer who is living '
                 'temporarily in Starkfield, Massachusetts while working on a '
                 'project in a nearby town, becomes curious about Ethan Frome. '
                 'The Narrator questions his landlady, Mrs. Ned Hale, and '
                 'Harmon Gow, a long-time resident and former stagecoach '
                 'driver, about Ethan. They provide The Narrator with bits and '
                 'pieces of information about Ethan, which make him even more '
                 "intrigued with the story of Ethan's life. Temporarily unable "
                 'to get to and from the train station in Corbury Flats, The '
                 "Narrator acts on Gow's suggestion and asks Ethan to "
                 'transport him back and forth. After a week of riding with '
                 'Ethan, The Narrator and Ethan are caught in a blinding '
                 'snowstorm on their return to Starkfield. Ethan invites The '
                 'Narrator to spend the night at his farmhouse. During his '
                 'unexpected stay with Ethan, The Narrator is able to glean '
                 "information about Ethan's life. As a young man, Ethan Frome "
                 'wanted to become an engineer. He left home, attended a '
                 'technological college in Worcester, Massachusetts, and spent '
                 'time in Florida actually working on a small engineering job. '
                 'His dream was to settle in a metropolitan area where he '
                 'could take advantage of the opportunities city life offered. '
                 "Unfortunately, Ethan's studies (as well as his dreams) come "
                 'to an abrupt halt when his father died and his mother became '
                 'ill soon afterwards. He returned to Starkfield, '
                 'Massachusetts to care for his mother and to run the family '
                 "farm and sawmill. Realizing that he couldn't do everything "
                 'by himself, he made arrangements for his cousin Zenobia '
                 '(Zeena) Pierce to live with them. Zeena took over the care '
                 "of Ethan's mother as well as the household duties. After his "
                 "mother's death, Ethan couldn't imagine being alone again on "
                 'the farm, so he married Zeena. In an attempt to reclaim his '
                 'dreams and move to a metropolitan area, Ethan tried to sell '
                 'the farm, but his efforts were unsuccessful. After a year of '
                 'marriage, Zeena became well known to the people in '
                 'Starkfield for her "sickliness." She suffered from a myriad '
                 'of illnesses and her disposition became irritable and '
                 "disagreeable. Ethan's dreams were doomed. As the main story "
                 "begins, Mattie Silver, a cousin of Zeena's whose parents' "
                 'deaths left her destitute, has been a part of the Frome '
                 'household for a year. Although Mattie is grateful to have a '
                 'roof over her head and work as an aide to her cousin, she '
                 'is, however, quite forgetful and often spends time dreaming '
                 'rather than working. As a result, Ethan, who has secretly '
                 'fallen in love with Mattie, completes many of her chores. '
                 'Three days before the "smash-up," Ethan goes one evening to '
                 'meet Mattie, who is socializing at a church dance, and walk '
                 'her home. He feels jealous when he observes Denis Eady, a '
                 'local grocer and proprietor of the livery stable, flirting '
                 'and dancing with Mattie. After Mattie refuses a ride home '
                 'with Eady, she and Ethan walk home arm-in-arm. The next day, '
                 "Zeena tells Ethan that she's going to Bettsbridge to see "
                 'Doctor Buck and spending the night with her Aunt Martha '
                 'Pierce. Zeena asks Ethan to drive her to the train station, '
                 "but Ethan tells her that he can't because he's going to see "
                 'Andrew Hale, owner of a construction company in Starkfield, '
                 'to get paid for lumber he sold him. He suggests that Jotham '
                 'Powell, a man who helps out around the Frome farm, drive her '
                 'to the train station. Because Ethan had no intention of '
                 'seeing Hale, he absolves his guilt about lying to Zeena by '
                 'actually going to see Hale and asking for an advance on his '
                 'load of lumber. As Ethan expects, Hale declines to pay him '
                 'then. That evening, Mattie makes a particularly nice supper '
                 "for Ethan. She even uses one of Zeena's best dishes, made of "
                 'red glass, which is stored on the top shelf in the china '
                 "closet. During the dinner, the cat knocks Zeena's red dish "
                 'off the table and it breaks on the floor. Ethan pieces the '
                 'dish together, puts it back on the shelf in the china '
                 'closet, and promises to glue it together before Zeena '
                 'returns home. The rest of the evening Ethan and Mattie spend '
                 'the evening conversing with each other, well content in each '
                 "other's company. The following day, Ethan rushes through his "
                 'work, then home to glue the red dish together before Zeena '
                 'returns home. To his surprise, when he gets home with the '
                 'glue, Zeena is already there. Zeena informs Ethan that she '
                 'has "complications" and will need a "hired girl." Zeena '
                 'tells Ethan that she hired a girl when she was in '
                 'Bettsbridge who will be arriving on the train the next '
                 'afternoon and that Mattie will have to leave so the new girl '
                 "can have Mattie's bedroom. Ethan is angry, but realizes that "
                 'Zeena will have her way. He tells Mattie that she will have '
                 'to leave and he kisses her for the first time. Zeena comes '
                 'into the kitchen furious because she has found her broken '
                 'red pickle dish. Ethan wants to go away with Mattie, but '
                 "can't leave Zeena destitute. He understands that he is "
                 "Zeena's prisoner. In the morning, Ethan again goes to visit "
                 'Mr. Hale to ask for advance payment on lumber, and on his '
                 'way, stops to speak to Mrs. Hale, who empathizes with him. '
                 "He realizes that he can't take advantage of the Hales' "
                 'understanding and returns home. Daniel Byrne, a neighbor, '
                 "takes Mattie's trunk to the train station. Ethan insists "
                 'that he will take Mattie to the train station himself. On '
                 'the way to the train station, Ethan takes Mattie to Shadow '
                 'Pond where they first fell in love with each other. At the '
                 'top of School House Hill, they find a sled and go sledding, '
                 'successfully swerving, just missing the elm tree at the '
                 'bottom of the hill. Before taking the sled down the hill '
                 'again, Mattie tells Ethan that she would sooner die than to '
                 'live without him. They agree that death would be better than '
                 'living apart. With the intention of committing suicide, '
                 'Mattie and Ethan head straight for the elm tree at the '
                 'bottom of the hill. The suicide attempt fails. Mattie is '
                 "taken to Mrs. Ned Hale's house to be cared for after the "
                 '"smash-up" and Ethan is taken to the minister\'s house. '
                 'Ethan and Mattie are taken to the Frome farmhouse when they '
                 'are physically able and are cared for by Zeena. Despite '
                 'injuries from the smash-up, including a permanent limp, '
                 'Ethan manages to support the three of them by resuming '
                 'working on the farm and in the sawmill. When The Narrator '
                 'stays overnight at the Frome farm, over twenty years after '
                 'the smash-up, he is surprised to find that Mattie — crippled '
                 'by the accident — complains incessantly. In fact, because '
                 'the women are now so much alike, he has difficulty '
                 'distinguishing them.',

{'author': 'Henry Adams',
 'book_title': 'The Education of Henry Adams',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': '"Probably no child, born in the year, held better cards than '
                 'he," the narrator says of the birth of Henry Brooks Adams in '
                 'Boston, Massachusetts, on February 16, 1838. Through a '
                 "series of impressions, he introduces the reader to Henry's "
                 'boyhood world. Winters in Boston are filled with restraint, '
                 'rules, confinement, school, and a sense of order that is '
                 'thrillingly interrupted by wild snowball fights. Summers at '
                 "his paternal grandparents' home in nearby Quincy bring "
                 'freedom, delight, hope, and a close relationship with '
                 'Grandfather John Quincy Adams, formerly the sixth President '
                 'of the United States. Henry is a child of privilege; that, '
                 'as much as anything, shapes the outer direction of his life. '
                 'But his world is rapidly changing, a theme that will affect '
                 "Henry's education throughout the book. Social change comes "
                 'first. A trip to Maryland, Virginia and Washington D. C., '
                 'with his father in 1850, introduces Henry to life in the '
                 'near South, its appealing informality contrasting with the '
                 'horrors of slavery, which the Adams family is devoted to '
                 'eradicating even though it will mean Civil War. The style of '
                 "the book affects the reader's understanding. The narrator is "
                 'Henry in his late sixties; he speaks in the third person, '
                 'treating the younger Henry objectively except for occasional '
                 "insights into the boy's attitudes. The reader rarely sees "
                 "Henry's emotions. Adams speaks of the key figure as a "
                 'manikin and his education as the various costumes draped '
                 'across it. The reader soon learns that Adams is using the '
                 'term "education" in an unusual, broad sense. He has little '
                 'use for formal schooling, including Harvard College where '
                 'Henry, as told in the book, is an average student but a good '
                 'writer and speaker, graduating in 1858 as the Class Orator. '
                 'During a two-year "Grand Tour" of Europe, Henry makes a lame '
                 'effort at studying law but finds that his German is '
                 'inadequate and ends up devoting a term to learning the '
                 'language in a Berlin prep school. He returns to work as a '
                 'private secretary to his father, a Congressman, in '
                 'Washington during the winter of 1860-1861. Having published '
                 'some travel letters in the Boston Daily Courier while in '
                 'Europe, Henry becomes the part-time Washington correspondent '
                 'for the Boston Daily Advertiser during the winter of '
                 'political turmoil leading up to the secession of many of the '
                 "slave states. Henry continues to serve as his father's "
                 "private secretary during Charles Francis Adams's tenure as "
                 'Minister to England (1861-1868). Frail and small (5\' 3" '
                 'tall), perhaps as the result of a nearly fatal bout of '
                 'scarlet fever as a child, Henry is not a likely warrior and '
                 'completely misses the American Civil War (1861-1865). '
                 "Nevertheless, the war years do contribute to Henry's "
                 "education and are especially intriguing because his father's "
                 'Legation (mission) deals with pro-Confederate sympathies in '
                 'England, and he successfully struggles to keep Britain '
                 "officially neutral. Henry's writing career progresses "
                 'despite some bumps. He is the secret London correspondent of '
                 'the New York Times for several months even though he knows '
                 'that exposure would embarrass his father and the American '
                 'Legation; he resigns only after nearly being discovered. '
                 'After Henry returns to the States in July 1868, he works as '
                 'a freelance political journalist in Washington, earning a '
                 'reputation as a reformer, especially in articles dealing '
                 'with American finance and the New York gold conspiracy. The '
                 'most poignant passage of the book (in Chapter XIX) concerns '
                 "the death of Henry's sister Louisa. While vacationing in "
                 'Europe, Henry learns that she has been in a cab accident '
                 'near her home in Italy. He rushes to her side, but tetanus '
                 'has already set in; she suffers an excruciating death a few '
                 'days later. Henry is despondent and seeks solace in a '
                 'monastery in England. Soon he receives a letter from the '
                 'president of Harvard, offering a position as assistant '
                 'professor of history and editor of the prestigious North '
                 "American Review. He accepts the offer. Despite Adams's "
                 'self-effacing claims to the contrary, Henry is an effective, '
                 'innovative teacher and editor. He pioneers the use of the '
                 'seminar system, advocates the study of American history, '
                 'introduces graduate studies in history, and encourages '
                 'student evaluations as well as the keeping of journals. '
                 'During the summer after his first academic year (1870-1871), '
                 'he meets Clarence King on a geological expedition in Estes '
                 'Park; King becomes a lifelong friend. The Education simply '
                 'skips the next twenty years (1872-1892). Rarely at ease with '
                 'emotion or personal matters, Adams apparently avoids '
                 'discussing the period because of his marriage to Marian '
                 'Hooper (1872) and her suicide on December 6, 1885, which he '
                 'never even mentions in the book. He does say that his life '
                 'has been cut in two; in his letters, he refers to the rest '
                 'of his life as "posthumous." However, some of his best work '
                 'remains. He is still interested in politics, advocating '
                 "independence for Cuba and supporting his friend John Hay's "
                 '"Open Door" policy in China. The Mont-Saint-Michel and '
                 'Chartres (1904) and The Education of Henry Adams (1907) are '
                 'privately published as companion pieces, representing, in '
                 'turn, the medieval Christian unity of the thirteenth century '
                 'and the burgeoning modern multiplicity of the age of '
                 'science. Adams works to develop his complex "Dynamic Theory '
                 'of History," discussed in detail in Chapters XXXIII and '
                 'XXXIV of the Education . The book ends in 1905, seven years '
                 "before Adams's partially paralyzing stroke, which leads to "
                 'his death on March 27, 1918.',

                 'between Italy and present-day Slovenia. Allied with Britain, '
                 'France, and Russia against the Austro-Hungarian Empire and '
                 'Germany, Italy is responsible for preventing the '
                 'Austro-Hungarian forces from assisting the Germans on the '
                 "war's western front, and Russia in the east. The novel's "
                 'narrator and protagonist is eventually identified as '
                 'Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American who has volunteered '
                 'for the Italian army because the United States has not yet '
                 'entered the war. Henry supervises a group of Italian '
                 'ambulance drivers. After a wintertime leave spent touring '
                 'the country, Lieutenant Henry returns to the captured town '
                 'at the front where his unit lives. One evening his roommate, '
                 'a surgeon and lieutenant in the Italian army named Rinaldi, '
                 'introduces Henry to two British nurses: Catherine Barkley '
                 'and her friend Helen Ferguson. Catherine and Henry talk of '
                 'the war and of her fiancé, killed in combat the year before; '
                 'clearly she has been traumatized by the experience. On his '
                 'second visit to the British hospital, they kiss. When Henry '
                 'again visits Catherine, she tells him that she loves him and '
                 'asks whether he loves her. He responds that he does. One '
                 'night, Lieutenant Henry and his fellow ambulance-drivers '
                 'settle into a dugout across the river from the enemy troops. '
                 'While the drivers are eating, the Austrian bombardment '
                 'wounds Henry in the leg and kills one of the other drivers. '
                 'Henry is transported by train to an American hospital in '
                 'Milan. Catherine Barkley arrives at the hospital, to which '
                 'she has been transferred. Once again, she and Lieutenant '
                 'Henry declare their love for each other, after which they '
                 'have sex in the hospital bed. Henry and Catherine spend the '
                 'summer together while he recuperates from an operation on '
                 'his leg, visiting restaurants around Milan in the evening '
                 "and then spending nights together. At summer's end, however, "
                 'Lieutenant Henry is ordered back to the front, and Catherine '
                 'tells him she is three months pregnant. On their last '
                 'evening together in Milan, Henry buys a pistol, and he and '
                 'Catherine take a room in a hotel. Soon after Lieutenant '
                 "Henry's return to the front, the Austrians (now joined by "
                 'German troops) bombard the Italian army and eventually break '
                 'through the lines near the town of Caporetto. Henry and the '
                 'other ambulance drivers retreat with the rest of the Italian '
                 'forces in a long, slow-moving column of troops and vehicles. '
                 'They pick up two Italian engineer-sergeants. Finally, the '
                 'ambulances pull off the main road. When one of the vehicles '
                 'becomes stuck in the mud, the two sergeants refuse to assist '
                 "in the effort to dislodge it and disobey Lieutenant Henry's "
                 'order to remain with the group. He fires at them, wounding '
                 "one; another ambulance driver then uses Henry's pistol to "
                 'finish the job. Henry and the three drivers abandon the '
                 'ambulances and set out on foot for the Tagliamento River, '
                 'across which lies safety. Soon they spot German soldiers in '
                 'the distance. One driver is shot to death by fellow Italians '
                 'firing in error. Another driver flees, to surrender to the '
                 'Germans. Finally safe from the enemy, Lieutenant Henry '
                 'observes that Italian army officers like himself are being '
                 'shot by the military police for deserting their troops. He '
                 'also fears being mistaken for a German spy. And so he dives '
                 'into the Tagliamento River, deserting the Italian army, and '
                 'swims ashore downstream. Henry crosses part of the Venetian '
                 'plain on foot, then boards a moving train, hiding among guns '
                 'stored beneath a tarpaulin. Frederic (no longer Lieutenant) '
                 'Henry arrives in Milan, incognito. Catherine Barkley and '
                 'Helen Ferguson are absent from the hospital, having gone on '
                 'holiday to the Italian resort town of Stresa. So Henry '
                 'travels via train to Stresa, where he finds Catherine and '
                 'Helen. Discovering late one night that Henry will be '
                 'arrested as a deserter in the morning, Henry and Catherine '
                 'quickly prepare to escape into neutral Switzerland. Through '
                 'the stormy night, they travel in a small, open boat across '
                 'Lake Maggiore. The following day they are arrested and '
                 'briefly detained by Swiss officials, after which they are '
                 'released. Frederic Henry and Catherine Barkley move into a '
                 'chalet on a mountain above Montreaux and spend an idyllic '
                 "winter there. At winter's end, they leave the mountains for "
                 'a hotel in Lausanne. Finally, Henry takes Catherine to the '
                 'hospital, where her baby is stillborn. Then, as a result of '
                 'multiple hemorrhages, Catherine dies as well.',

 'summary_text': 'Set in the twenty-fourth century, Fahrenheit 451 introduces '
                 'a new world in which control of the masses by the media, '
                 'overpopulation, and censorship has taken over the general '
                 'population. The individual is not accepted and the '
                 'intellectual is considered an outlaw. Television has '
                 'replaced the common perception of family. The fireman is now '
                 'seen as a flamethrower, a destroyer of books rather than an '
                 'insurance against fire. Books are considered evil because '
                 'they make people question and think. The people live in a '
                 'world with no reminders of history or appreciation of the '
                 'past; the population receives the present from television. '
                 'Ray Bradbury introduces this new world through the character '
                 'Guy Montag, the protagonist, during a short time in his '
                 'life. The story begins with an inciting incident in which '
                 'Montag meets Clarisse McClellan. Montag, a fireman who '
                 'destroys books for a living, is walking home from work one '
                 'day when the young Clarisse approaches him and introduces '
                 'herself. Clarisse is the antithesis of anyone Montag has '
                 'ever met. She is young, pretty, and energetic, but more '
                 'importantly, she converses with him about things that he has '
                 'never considered. Her inquisitive nature fascinates him '
                 'because she ponders things such as happiness, love, and, '
                 'more importantly, the contents of the books that he burns. '
                 'At first, Montag tries to ignore her questions, but on the '
                 'rest of his walk home, he cannot get the young girl out of '
                 'his mind. Upon entering his home, however, her image is '
                 'quickly erased. Montag enters his bedroom to find an empty '
                 'bottle of sleeping pills lying on the floor next to his bed. '
                 'He discovers that his wife Mildred (Millie), whether '
                 'intentionally or unintentionally, has overdosed on the '
                 'pills. He calls the emergency squad, and the strangers come '
                 'with their machine to save his wife. The next morning, '
                 'Montag attempts to discuss what happened the night before, '
                 'but his wife is uninterested in any type of discussion. She '
                 "avoids Montag's questions and instead focuses on the new "
                 'script she has received for an interactive television '
                 'program. Montag, though frustrated and confused about what '
                 'happened the previous night, heads off to work. On his way '
                 'to work, Montag again encounters Clarisse and is left '
                 'pondering things like the taste of rain and what dandelions '
                 'represent. He enters the fire station and immediately '
                 'encounters the Mechanical Hound, who actually growls at him. '
                 'Because of this brief encounter, Montag realizes that the '
                 "Hound doesn't like him, a point that he quickly points out "
                 'to his fellow fireman, Captain Beatty. Several days pass '
                 "since Montag's last meeting with Clarisse. During one of his "
                 'final conversations with Clarisse, Montag learns that she '
                 'fears the violence in her peers. She points out that their '
                 'world used to be an entirely different world, one where '
                 'pictures showed actual people and people talked about '
                 'important things. One day at the fire station, the firemen '
                 'receive a call that an old woman has stashed books in her '
                 'house. The firemen race to her home and begin destroying the '
                 'contraband. Montag urges the woman to leave the house '
                 'because the entire home will be destroyed, but she refuses '
                 'to leave her precious books. The home, along with the old '
                 'woman and her books, is set aflame, but not before Montag '
                 'steals one of the books. Later the same night, Montag tries '
                 'to discuss the day with Millie, but she is not interested in '
                 'what he has to say. During their conversation, Montag '
                 'discovers from Millie that Clarisse was killed in an '
                 'automobile accident. Montag decides to call in sick to work '
                 'the next day, but he is surprised by a visit from Beatty. '
                 'Somehow, Beatty knows that Montag is keeping a book, and he '
                 'is interested in reading it. Beatty converses at great '
                 'length with Montag and tells him that every fireman gets the '
                 'itch to read a book at some point in his career. Beatty also '
                 'tells Montag that even though he may keep the book for '
                 'twenty-four hours, he must return to work, with book in '
                 'hand, so the book can be properly destroyed. After this '
                 'meeting, Montag shows Millie that he has been hiding, not '
                 'just one book, but a cache of books in the house for some '
                 'time. He then convinces Millie to sit and read the books '
                 'with him. While reading, Montag attempts to converse with '
                 'Millie about the content of the books but finds that she '
                 'cannot comprehend, nor does she want to comprehend, what '
                 'they are reading. At this point, Montag remembers an old, '
                 'retired English professor, Faber, whom he had met in a park. '
                 'Montag decides to visit Faber to gain more understanding '
                 'about books and his recurrent thoughts. Upon reaching '
                 "Faber's house, Montag is first greeted by the old man with "
                 'fear. Faber worries that Montag has come to burn his books '
                 "and home, but he is quickly pacified when he sees Montag's "
                 'Bible and hears that Montag wants to talk with him. During '
                 'their conversation, Faber agrees to teach Montag, and he '
                 'gives Montag a seashell radio so they can communicate with '
                 'one another. Montag returns home to find Mrs. Phelps and '
                 "Mrs. Bowles, two of Millie's friends, at his home. Feeling "
                 'especially courageous, Montag decides to enlighten them by '
                 'reading "Dover Beach," but instead, he causes problems for '
                 'himself because he scares the women. They flee the house in '
                 'tears, and Millie is angry with him for causing the scene. '
                 'With Faber still speaking in his ear, Montag returns to work '
                 'and gives Beatty a book, which is promptly incinerated. '
                 'After a lengthy discussion with Beatty, an alarm comes into '
                 'the station, and the firemen rush to destroy the next house. '
                 'When the firemen stop in front of the unfortunate house, '
                 'Montag is surprised to see his own home. Promptly, Beatty '
                 'orders Montag to destroy his home and places him under '
                 'arrest. Montag takes a perverse pleasure in destroying the '
                 'home, especially the television, and in the following '
                 'moments, he also kills Beatty with his flamethrower. The '
                 'Mechanical Hound attacks Montag before he can escape, but he '
                 'destroys it with fire before the Hound can destroy him. '
                 "Montag runs to Faber's home for protection but quickly "
                 'realizes that he is endangering Faber. Thus, he stops at the '
                 'home of Black, a fellow fireman, and hides the books inside '
                 "the house to incriminate him. Montag then reaches Faber's "
                 'home, and Faber tells him to escape down the river because '
                 'another Mechanical Hound is on the search for him. After '
                 'helping Faber rid all trace of him, Montag races toward the '
                 'river in hopes of escaping the search. By the time the '
                 "Mechanical Hound reaches the river, Montag's trail is lost. "
                 'He safely floats down the river toward a group of social '
                 'outcasts and criminals like himself. Montag leaves the river '
                 'and immediately finds the group that Faber told him about. '
                 'He meets the unacknowledged leader of the group, Granger, '
                 'who welcomes Montag to join them. Although he thought that '
                 'the search was called off, Montag finds out that it was just '
                 'rerouted. He watches on television as an innocent man, '
                 'strolling along the city streets, is purposefully identified '
                 'as Montag and is killed for the entire television audience '
                 'to see. The group decides to move on from their current '
                 'site, and while they are walking, Granger explains the '
                 'purpose of the outlaw group: They are preserving books by '
                 'memorizing their contents and then destroying them. Books '
                 'can not be forgotten, because each person in the group is a '
                 'living version of them. Montag becomes the Book of '
                 'Ecclesiastes from the Bible. As the men continue in their '
                 'journey, Montag and Granger watch as bombs fall upon the '
                 'city and destroy everything in their path. The final war has '
                 'begun. Although the men are escaping the city, they decide, '
                 'without discussion, to return to the city with Montag in the '
                 'lead.',

                 'suggests. Perceiving her beauty, he proposes to her and is '

                 'manages to obtain employment on the estate. Bathsheba '
                 "inherits her uncle's farm, and it is she who employs Gabriel "
                 'as a shepherd. She intends to manage the farm by herself. '
                 'Her farmhands have reservations about the abilities of this '

                 'valentine to a neighboring landowner, Mr. Boldwood, a '
                 'middle-aged bachelor. His curiosity and, subsequently, his '
                 "emotions are seriously aroused, and he becomes Bathsheba's "

                 'does his work, gives advice when asked, and usually '
                 'withholds it when not consulted. But it is her third suitor, '
                 'Sergeant Francis Troy, who, with his flattery, insouciance, '
                 'and scarlet uniform, finally captures the interest of '
                 'Bathsheba. Troy, who does not believe in promises, and '
                 'laments with some truth that "women will be the death of '

                 'that her marriage is over. Bathsheba is remorseful but '
                 'somewhat relieved when Troy disappears. His clothes are '
                 'found on the shore of a bay where there is a strong current. '
                 'People accept the circumstantial evidence of his death, but '
                 'Bathsheba knows intuitively that he is alive. Troy does '
                 'return, over a year later, just as Boldwood, almost mad, is '
                 "trying to exact Bathsheba's promise that she will marry him "

                 'feelings of humiliation through the consumption of homemade '
                 'rice wine and becomes an angry, bitter, drunken recluse. '
                 'Jeanne avoids family disorder by hiding under the bed, '
                 'studying catechism, playing hopscotch, and learning ballet. '
                 'In spring 1943, the family locates better accommodations at '

                 'pear trees. Jeanne enjoys normal school experiences, '
                 'including participation in glee club and yearbook '
                 'activities. Camp life grows difficult as a result of '

                 'including Woody, disagree with the older generation and sign '

 'book_title': 'The Fountainhead',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Fountainhead takes place in the United States, mostly in '
                 'New York City, during the 1920s and 1930s. It chronicles the '
                 'struggles of the innovative architect Howard Roark in his '
                 'effort to achieve success on his own terms. As the story '
                 'opens, twenty-one-year-old Roark is expelled from the '
                 'Stanton Institute of Technology for "insubordination." Most '
                 'faculty and administration members want him to design in '
                 'traditional styles, but Roark has his own ideas. On the '
                 "other hand, Peter Keating, a classmate of Roark's and the "
                 'son of the woman whose boardinghouse Roark lives in, though '
                 "lacking Roark's brilliance and love of architecture, gives "
                 'the professors exactly what they want and graduates as '
                 'valedictorian with high honors. After leaving Stanton, Roark '
                 'goes to work for Henry Cameron, an elderly and cantankerous '
                 'genius, whose ideas are far ahead of their time. Cameron is '
                 'a commercial failure, but an uncompromising man of '
                 'integrity. Though a successful architect in the 1880s, '
                 "Cameron's ideas became increasingly revolutionary, resulting "
                 'finally in the birth of the skyscraper. He is one of the '
                 'first to design buildings that tower over others, and the '
                 'first to insist that a tall building should look tall. Where '
                 'other architects use every device they can to make their '
                 'tall buildings appear shorter, Cameron openly flaunts his '
                 "skyscrapers' height. When American society falls under the "
                 'sway of the Classical styles highlighted in the Columbian '
                 "Exposition of 1892, Cameron's modernist ideas are rejected. "
                 "Compounding the problem is Cameron's contemptuous rejection "
                 'of those not open to change. His hostility only increases '
                 'the difficulty that a public fearful of progress has in '
                 'recognizing his genius. Roark works for him for three years '
                 "(until Cameron's health fails) and learns to perfect the "
                 'great and original talent he possesses. After graduating '
                 'from Stanton, Keating works for Guy Francon, the most '
                 'successful and prestigious architect in the country. Francon '
                 'is a mediocre architect who copies from the designers of the '
                 "past; but he gives the public what it's used to, and, with a "
                 'superb mastery of the social graces, he wines and dines '
                 "prospective clients at New York's most exclusive "
                 'restaurants. Francon is a phony, who teaches Keating only '
                 'about manipulating and influencing people, not about '
                 'building honestly and effectively. Francon has a beautiful '
                 'young daughter, Dominique, who possesses a mind of her own. '
                 'Brilliant and outspoken, she is brutally frank in '
                 'criticizing the buildings of her father and his young '
                 'protégé. Dominique writes a column devoted to design and '
                 'interior decorating in The New York Banner , a daily '
                 'newspaper owned by the powerful publisher, Gail Wynand. '
                 'Dominique is a passionate idealist who recognizes and '
                 'reveres the human potential for greatness. But finding '
                 'little of it in the world — indeed, finding everywhere the '
                 'triumph of vulgar mediocrity — she becomes disillusioned. '
                 'Dominique believes that true nobility has no chance to '
                 'succeed in a world dominated by the mindless and the '
                 'corrupt. She recognizes and loathes the unscrupulous '
                 'pandering engaged in by Keating and her father — and states '
                 'her convictions openly. But Keating, smitten with the way in '
                 'which her beauty and elegance impress other people, proposes '
                 'marriage. Dominique replies that if she ever seeks to punish '
                 "herself for some terrible crime she's committed, she will "
                 "accept his offer. Despite Dominique's recognition of his "
                 'fraudulent methods, Keating enjoys great early success. By '
                 'the manipulation of fellow employees, Keating rises in '
                 "Francon's firm until, after only several years, he is the "
                 "company's chief designer. Though not adept at design, "
                 'Keating knows someone who is: Howard Roark, whose love of '
                 'buildings is so great that he cannot refuse any opportunity '
                 'to improve one. Roark helps Keating in his design work. But '
                 "now, Keating has his sights set on becoming Francon's "
                 'partner, a position currently held by the sickly Lucius '
                 'Heyer. At this time comes the announcement for the '
                 'Cosmo-Slotnick Building, a competition held by a Hollywood '
                 'company to design the "world\'s most beautiful building." '
                 'Francon trusts Keating to win; Keating knows he cannot do '
                 'it, so he turns to Roark for help. Roark designs a brilliant '
                 'and simple plan for his building, to which Keating adds his '
                 'customary ostentatious ornamentation. Keating believes his '
                 'eclectic hodgepodge of conflicting styles has no chance to '
                 'win; he must get the partnership now, while Francon still '
                 'trusts him. He berates Heyer, screaming at the old man to '
                 'retire, causing the stroke the doctors had feared. Heyer '
                 'dies, having left the charming Keating his money. Keating '
                 'wins the Cosmo-Slotnick competition. Francon makes him '
                 'partner. Keating is now wealthy, famous, and a partner in '
                 "the country's most prestigious architectural firm. Roark, "
                 "meanwhile, struggles to find employment after Cameron's "
                 "retirement. His brief tenure at Francon's firm ends when he "
                 'refuses to design as Francon wishes him to. For a long '
                 'period of time, Roark cannot find employment with any '
                 'architect. Eventually, he is hired by John Erik Snyte, an '
                 'eclectic builder who is not wedded to any specific school of '
                 'design. Snyte is content to give the public whatever it '
                 'desires. He employs specialists in various schools of design '
                 '— Classical, Gothic, Renaissance — and wants Roark to be his '
                 'modernist. Snyte allows his designers freedom to design in '
                 'their specialties, but then combines their ideas into one '
                 'finished product of clashing principles. Roark can design as '
                 "he likes at Snyte's, but he will never see a building "
                 'erected as he creates it. Eventually, the newspaperman, '
                 'Austen Heller, recognizes his talent and hires him to build '
                 'a private home. Roark opens his own office, but his designs '
                 'are too revolutionary, and he receives very few commissions. '
                 'When Roark turns down the commission for the important '
                 'Manhattan Bank Building rather than permit the adulteration '
                 'of his design, he is destitute. He closes his office '
                 'temporarily and goes to work in a granite quarry in '
                 'Connecticut. The quarry is owned by Guy Francon. That '
                 'summer, Dominique vacations at the family estate bordering '
                 'the property. Upon meeting Roark, Dominique notices '
                 'immediately the taut lines of his body and the scornful look '
                 'of his eyes. Though at a conscious level, Dominique believes '
                 'he may be an ex-convict like others of the work gang, at '
                 'some deeper level she knows better. The way he holds himself '
                 'and moves, his posture and mannerisms, his countenance and '
                 'the look in his eyes all convey a proud dignity that would '
                 'not stoop to the commission of crimes. She is deeply drawn '
                 'to him and initiates a pursuit that results in their '
                 'passionate lovemaking. But despite her profound attraction '
                 'and aggressive pursuit, she is afraid of a love relationship '
                 'with him. She ardently desires their sexual relationship, '
                 'but almost as intensely fears it. She both physically '
                 'resists Roark when he finally comes to her and experiences '
                 'their lovemaking — "the thing she had thought about, had '
                 'expected" — as the most powerful experience of her life. '
                 "Dominique's inner conflict torments her, and, despite the "
                 'love between them, it is years before they can happily be '
                 'together. Before their relationship fully gets under way at '
                 "the quarry, Roark's whereabouts are discovered by Roger "
                 'Enright, an innovative businessman who wants Roark to design '
                 'a new type of apartment building. Roark leaves the quarry '
                 'and returns to New York. Even then, he finds himself '
                 'thinking of Dominique. The construction of the Enright House '
                 'brings Roark recognition and further commissions. Anthony '
                 'Cord, a successful Wall Street businessman, hires him to '
                 'build his first office building, a fifty-story skyscraper in '
                 'the center of Manhattan. Kent Lansing, a member of the board '
                 'formed to build a luxury hotel on Central Park South, wants '
                 'Roark and fights for him. Eventually, he wins, and Roark '
                 'signs a contract to build the Aquitania Hotel. Although '
                 'construction of the Aquitania is eventually stopped due to '
                 'legal wrangles, Kent Lansing vows to win control of the '
                 "project and complete it. Roark's growing fame attracts the "
                 'attention of architectural critic Ellsworth Toohey, who is '
                 'threatened by his unbending independence of spirit. Toohey, '
                 'who seeks power over the architectural profession, attempts '
                 'to end the career of this individualist who will not obey. '
                 'He influences a wealthy lackey, Hopton Stoddard, to hire '
                 "Roark to build a temple. Knowing that Roark's design will be "
                 'breathtakingly original, Toohey plots to attack it as '
                 'contrary to all established religious principles, thereby '
                 'turning Roark into an enemy of religion. Because Roark is an '
                 'atheist, Toohey coaches Stoddard regarding the best means to '
                 'approach Roark to build a religious structure. He has '
                 'Stoddard say, "But you\'re a profoundly religious man, Mr. '
                 'Roark — in your own way. I can see that in your buildings." '
                 'Roark accepts the commission to build a temple to the heroic '
                 "human spirit. At this point, Roark's career is on an "
                 'upswing. He designs a masterpiece for the Stoddard Temple, '
                 'as Toohey knew he would. He hires Steven Mallory to do the '
                 'sculpture for the Temple. Mallory is a brilliant young '
                 'talent, who sculpts in the Classic Greek style, emphasizing '
                 'the nobility and grandeur of man. Dominique poses nude for '
                 "the Temple's central piece of sculpture, and Mallory "
                 'captures both the beauty of her body and the independence of '
                 'her spirit in his work. Mallory, though young, has already '
                 'suffered rejection because of the striking originality of '
                 'his pieces, and is beginning to grow cynical regarding an '
                 "innovative thinker's chances of gaining practical success. "
                 'His relationship with Roark, however, inspires him. After '
                 'his work on the Stoddard Temple, although still suffering '
                 'from moments of despair, Mallory never again reaches the '
                 'depths of torment he is in when Roark meets him. But Toohey, '
                 'as was his plan, manipulates both Stoddard and the public. '
                 "He denounces Roark's Temple as heretical, and society "
                 'follows his lead, sending up a chorus of protests. The '
                 'Stoddard Temple is torn down, and Roark is condemned as an '
                 "apostate. Roark's career is now in a downturn in which he "
                 'receives only a few very minor commissions. Dominique, in '
                 'agony at the attack on the hero she loves, marries Keating — '
                 'the most despicable individual she can find — in an attempt '
                 'to kill off in herself that greatness of soul that enables '
                 'her to love only man at his highest and best. The '
                 "destruction of the Stoddard Temple confirms Dominique's "
                 'worst fears. It convinces her that she was right in wanting '
                 'to avoid entanglement in a romantic relationship with Roark. '
                 'His creative work and uncompromising character have no '
                 'chance in a world that merely follows the beliefs it has '
                 'been taught. He will be destroyed, just as Cameron was. This '
                 'was, and remains, her deepest belief. Given her values, '
                 'Dominique must love Roark and everything about the human '
                 'potential that he represents. She loves man the noble hero. '
                 "But society, in her view, leaves no place for such a hero's "
                 'triumph. Therefore, the only choice, as Dominique sees it, '
                 'is to kill off in herself her capacity for hero worship. In '
                 'so doing, she can escape her agony when presented with the '
                 'destruction of greatness. She believes that the way to kill '
                 'in herself her capacity to respond to Roark is to thoroughly '
                 'immerse herself in the life of Keating. The love of virtue '
                 'and beauty, she hopes, cannot survive absorption into a life '
                 'filled with corruption and ugliness. With full conscious '
                 'intent, she marries Peter Keating. Keating and Dominique are '
                 "married for twenty months. Through Toohey's manipulation, "
                 'Dominique is introduced to newspaper publisher Gail Wynand, '
                 'for whose paper Dominique formerly worked as a columnist. '
                 'The powerful Wynand is a man of mixed premises. Like '
                 'Dominique, he worships man the noble hero, but, unlike her, '
                 'he has sold his soul, publishing The Banner , a yellow-press '
                 'scandal sheet, gaining him wealth and influence. Wynand, '
                 "taken with Dominique's intelligence and idealism, as well as "
                 'with her beauty, proposes marriage. Dominique, thinking '
                 "she's found a man even lower than Keating, accepts; she "
                 'divorces Keating and marries Wynand. The powerful publisher '
                 "buys Keating's consent with a hefty check and the commission "
                 'for Stoneridge Homes, a housing development he is building. '
                 'But on her way to Reno to obtain the divorce, Dominique '
                 'stops in the small town of Clayton, Ohio, where Roark is '
                 'building a small department store. She has not seen him '
                 'since her marriage to Keating. Roark notices from her '
                 'questions that she is still concerned with other people and '
                 'their ability to hurt — or even observe — him. She tells him '
                 'that she wishes to remain with him in this small town. She '
                 'says they can marry, that she will wash his clothes and cook '
                 'his meals, and that he will give up architecture and work in '
                 'a store. Out of consideration for her, he tries not to '
                 'laugh. He tells her if he were cruel, he would accept her '
                 'offer just to see how long it would take her to beg him to '
                 'return to architecture. She understands. Roark knows that '
                 'Dominique is not ready to stay with him. She boards the '
                 'train for Reno and, after her divorce, marries Gail Wynand. '
                 'Wynand, though a man who panders to the masses in his '
                 "professional life, privately worships only man's noblest "
                 'achievements. Holding the same basic premises as Dominique, '
                 'it is logical that he loves her. He becomes fanatically '
                 'jealous of sharing Dominique with others. Wynand wishes to '
                 'build a home in the country as an isolated fortress, so he '
                 'will not have to see Dominique among the people of the city. '
                 "Every time Wynand has seen a building he's admired, the "
                 'architect has always been Howard Roark. So Wynand hires '
                 "Roark to build his home. Wynand greatly admires both Roark's "
                 'integrity and his genius, and he uses his great influence to '
                 "bring to Roark a number of commissions. Roark's prominent "
                 'buildings in New York City slowly begin to attract a growing '
                 'number of individuals who understand the revolutionary '
                 'nature of his designs. Roark receives more commissions and '
                 'becomes better known. One of the more prominent commissions '
                 'he receives prior to his relationship with Wynand is for the '
                 'Monadnock Valley Resort. The owners of the resort conceive '
                 'it as a swindle. They sell two hundred percent of it. They '
                 'are certain it will fail. They want it to fail. They choose '
                 'Roark as the worst architect they can find. They believe '
                 "that Roark's plan for separate houses where people can enjoy "
                 'privacy, rather than be clustered together in one huge ant '
                 'colony of a hotel, is an antisocial scheme bound to fail. '
                 "They hire him because of it. But Roark's idea satisfies a "
                 'need for a resort that was not currently met — and his '
                 'design is spectacularly beautiful. People come, and the '
                 'resort is successful. The owners are arrested for fraud, but '
                 'Roark is not involved in the legal case. The simple fact, '
                 'however, that Roark made money for people who did not want '
                 'to make money impresses businessmen, and Roark receives '
                 "commissions. Additionally, at the time of Monadnock's "
                 'completion, Roark receives a telegram from Kent Lansing, now '
                 "the legal owner of the Aquitania Hotel. Although Roark's "
                 "original intent was to spend the first summer of Monadnock's "
                 'existence at the resort, he now returns to New York City to '
                 'complete the hotel. The climax of The Fountainhead begins '
                 "when Keating, whose career is slipping because he's been "
                 'replaced by a newer trend, begs Roark to design for him '
                 'plans for the new low-income housing project called '
                 'Cortlandt Homes. Keating knows he cannot solve the problems '
                 'of design, and does not attempt to. Instead, he brings the '
                 'specifications to Roark. Keating requests that Roark design '
                 'it and allow Keating to take the credit for it. Roark knows '
                 'that he can do it and is eager to. He also knows that he '
                 'could never get approved by Toohey, who is the '
                 'behind-the-scenes power on the project. Roark agrees only on '
                 'the condition that the buildings be erected exactly as he '
                 'designs them; Keating agrees. Keating will receive the '
                 'recognition, the money, and whatever other benefits society '
                 'may confer on a man — but Roark will build Cortlandt. Roark '
                 'designs a masterpiece, Keating submits it as his, and Toohey '
                 'accepts it. But when Roark is away on a cruise with Wynand, '
                 "two of Toohey's lackeys alter Roark's design. When Roark "
                 'returns, he dynamites the defaced masterpiece and allows '
                 'himself to be arrested. Significantly, he enlists '
                 "Dominique's aid in the dynamiting. Whereas years earlier, "
                 'she had been afraid that society would reject him, now she '
                 'is not afraid to help Roark in an act for which society may '
                 'imprison him. Roark knows that Dominique is now ready for '
                 'their relationship. Wynand embarks on a crusade to save '
                 'Roark. Believing that his papers mold public opinion, Wynand '
                 "defends Roark vociferously in The Banner . But Wynand's "
                 'public does not care if a great genius has been wronged; '
                 "they stop reading the paper in protest of Wynand's stance. "
                 'When Wynand is out of town in a desperate attempt to save an '
                 'advertising contract, Toohey strikes. Toohey, who writes a '
                 'column for The Banner , has schemed for years to take over '
                 'the paper. Gradually, he has maneuvered his followers into '
                 'key editorial positions, and they all come out against '
                 'Roark. When Wynand fires them, the union, controlled by '
                 "Toohey, goes on strike. Wynand, with Dominique's help, "
                 'struggles to get out the paper, but it comes back unread. To '
                 'save the paper, Wynand is forced to reverse his stand on the '
                 'Cortlandt dynamiting. At his trial, Roark defends the right '
                 'of the creator to the product of his effort. Roark points '
                 'out that it was he who designed Cortlandt and that he was '
                 'not paid for his work. The only price — that it be erected '
                 'as designed — was not paid. He argues that an individual is '
                 'not a slave to society, and that society has a claim to a '
                 "creator's work only on his own terms. He points out that, "
                 'down through the ages, creative men have often developed '
                 'beneficial new ideas and products, only to be rejected by '
                 'their societies. Despite social opposition, the creators '
                 'move ahead, carrying the rest of mankind with them. '
                 'Cortlandt Homes is the product of his mind; it is his '
                 'creation and belongs to him. If society wants it — as it '
                 'does — justice requires that his asking price be paid. It '
                 'must be built as he designed it. The jury understands his '
                 'position and votes to acquit him. Roger Enright buys '
                 'Cortlandt Homes from the government and hires Roark to build '
                 'it; Wynand, as long planned, hires Roark to build the Wynand '
                 'Building, the tallest skyscraper in the city. Roark has '
                 "achieved commercial success on his own terms. The novel's "
                 'climax brings to resolution the struggles of all five of the '

                 'the field of architecture. After decades of the battle that '
                 'he and Cameron fought, their new methods are ultimately '
                 'gaining recognition. Dominique, seeing that she was mistaken '
                 'in believing that a genius like Roark has no chance in a '
                 'corrupt world, is liberated from her fears and is finally '
                 'free to marry him. Wynand is psychologically and morally '
                 'crushed by the realization that success did not require him '
                 'to sell his soul to the masses, that his professional life '

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "Caesar's Gallic Wars essays chronicle the history of his "
                 'military engagements during the years 58-51 B.C. in Gaul, '
                 'Germany, and Britain. And, as an aid to his readers, he '
                 'provides expository information for those who are unfamiliar '
                 'with the far-off lands and people encountered during his '
                 'forays. He opens his book, for example, with a brief '
                 'description of Gaul, then tells how the Helvetii are first '
                 'aroused to rebellion by Orgetorix in 61 B.C. and how, after '
                 "Orgetorix' death, they continue their preparations for war, "
                 'finally beginning military operations in 58 B.C. Since they '
                 'plan to march through an area bordering on the Roman '
                 'Province, Caesar feels that they represent a threat to Roman '
                 'rule, so he directs his forces against them. And, after '
                 'defeating the Helvetii, he fights the Germans who have been '
                 'brought to Gaul by the Sequani tribe. Then, unexplainably, '
                 'there is a moment of panic within the Roman army, but it '
                 'manages to regain its courage and crushes the German forces. '
                 'One of the few to escape, unfortunately, is Ariovistus, a '
                 'principal German leader. Book II covers the events of a year '
                 'later, 57 B.C.; now Caesar battles the Belgae in northern '
                 'Gaul, and Publius Crassus battles the maritime states on the '
                 'coast of Gaul. These two operations significantly extend the '
                 "area of Rome's influence, and the Roman Senate and the "
                 "populace acknowledge Caesar's achievement by celebrating a "
                 'thanksgiving of fifteen days. Book III finds Caesar, during '
                 '56 B.C., sending Servius Galba to open a toll-free route '
                 'through the Alps. But, after this is done, Servius is '
                 'attacked by the Seduni and Veragri tribes, and after '
                 'defending himself, finally moves his legion back to safer '
                 'territory for the rest of the winter. Meanwhile, the Veneti, '
                 'one of the coastal tribe subdued by Crassus the previous '
                 'year, begin a rebellion that spreads through the area, so '
                 'Caesar decides to move against them; his navy wins a major '
                 'sea battle that ends the rebellion. Other parts of his army, '
                 'under the direction of Titurius Sabinus and Publius Crassus, '
                 'defeat the Venelli and their allies under Viridovix, and the '
                 'tribes of Aquitania. Caesar then subdues the Morini and the '
                 'Menapii tribes. Book IV concerns the Usipetes and the '
                 'Tencteri, two German tribes driven from their homes by the '
                 'Suebi in 55 B.C. The tribes cross the Rhine in search of new '
                 'territory, but are defeated finally when Caesar drives them '
                 'out and moves his own army into Germany for the first time. '
                 'Then, because some of the Gallic tribes have received '
                 'military aid from Britain, Caesar decides to make a brief '
                 'trip across the channel, something no Roman force has done '
                 'before. He twice defeats the Britons, then returns to Gaul '
                 'to quell the Morini rebellion and accepts the surrender of '
                 'the Menapii. Afterward, the Senate decrees a thanksgiving of '
                 'twenty days; once more, an unprecedented honor. Book V, '
                 "chronicling the events of 54 B.C., tells of Caesar's return "
                 'to Britain with a fleet estimated at 600 ships. He fights '
                 'his way to the Thames, then moves back to the coast and '
                 'defeats the British force, commanded by Cassivelaunus. After '
                 'his return to Gaul, there is a revolt of the Belgae '
                 'precipitated by Ambiorix and Catuvolcus. Ambiorix '
                 'successfully tricks and destroys the Roman legion commanded '
                 'by Sabinus and Cotta. The Nervii attack another Roman camp, '
                 'but the commander, Cicero, holds them off until Caesar '
                 'arrives with reinforcements. Labienus defeats a large Gallic '
                 'force led against him by Indutiomarus, leader of the '
                 'Treveri. Book VI, the shortest of the hooks in the Gallic '
                 "Wars, relates Caesar's adventures during 53 B.C. and also "
                 'concerns itself with giving us an idea of the different '
                 'cultures of the Germans and the Gauls. As for the battle '
                 'narrative itself, it concerns an early revolt of several '
                 'tribes, quelled by Caesar and Labienus. Also, Caesar again '
                 'crosses the Rhine, but the Suebi retreat into their forests '
                 'and he decides against pursuing them and returns to Gaul, '
                 'where he defeats the rebel Eburones forces under Ambiorix. '
                 "Finally, Book VII, the longest in Caesar's narrative, "
                 'describes how, in 52 B.C., Caesar manages to withstand the '
                 'revolt of fourteen of the Gallic tribes. Many, of course, do '
                 'not freely join the rebellion, but are drawn in by political '
                 'intrigues of various kinds; even the usually faithful Aedui '
                 "turn against Rome. Caesar's forces take a number of enemy "
                 'strongholds — Vellaunodunum, Cenabum, Noviodunum, and '
                 'Avaricum — but they are almost defeated at Gergovia. The '
                 'Gallic revolt spreads and reaches its greatest dimension '
                 'under the leadership of vercingetorix, an Arvernian warrior '
                 'of great power whose father had been chieftain of Gaul. In a '
                 'major battle at Alesia, the Roman forces defeat '
                 "Vercingetorix' army and the revolt ends. Rome once more "
                 'proclaims a thanksgiving of twenty days to honor Caesar for '
                 'having reconquered Gaul.',

                 'John Grimes, the protagonist. John begins his day by '
                 'entering the kitchen where his mother, Elizabeth, and '
                 "younger brother, Roy, are arguing about Gabriel, the boys' "
                 "father. Roy is upset because he doesn't feel that he has the "
                 'type of relationship with his father that he should. Gabriel '
                 'is distant, and his children do not feel comfortable talking '
                 'to him; he is also brutal, beating his children for their '
                 'transgressions. After John finishes his breakfast and '

                 'decides to see a movie, an activity forbidden by his '
                 'strictly religious father. Upon returning home, John learns '
                 "that Roy has been stabbed. Gabriel, who is treating Roy's "
                 'wound with uncharacteristic gentleness, turns his anger upon '
                 "Elizabeth, blaming the boys' mother for Roy's wild ways. "
                 "Despite the attempt of Gabriel's sister, Florence, to talk "

                 'protect his mother, also receives a beating from Gabriel. '
                 "The next scene finds John and Elisha, John's friend and "

                 'They complete their work in time for Saturday evening Tarry '
                 'Service. John is not surprised to see his mother and father '
                 'enter the church, but he is surprised to see that his aunt '
                 'has accompanied them. Part Two, "The Prayers of the Saints," '
                 'begins with "Florence\'s Prayer." Florence kneels at the '
                 'altar, trying to remember how to pray. Her thoughts stray '
                 'back to her childhood and the bitterness that she felt '
                 "towards Gabriel because, being a boy and their mother's "
                 'favorite, he was given everything their mother could afford. '
                 'Despite all the sacrifices made by his mother and all of the '
                 'deprivations suffered by Florence for his good, Gabriel '
                 'wasted his education and continually caused trouble in and '
                 'around town. As Gabriel grew, so did his vices. Playing '
                 'hooky and causing mischief turned into drinking and '
                 'gambling. Finally Florence had had enough. She bought a '
                 'train ticket to New York City, said goodbye to her dying '
                 'mother and bewildered brother, and left. In New York, '
                 'Florence married Frank, mistakenly believing that she could '
                 'control him. After an evening of especially bitter arguing, '
                 'Frank walked out, never to return. Florence learned much '
                 'later from the woman Frank had moved in with that he had '
                 'been killed oversees during WWI and was buried in France. '
                 "Back in the present, Florence hears Gabriel's voice, which "
                 "triggers thoughts of her childhood friend and Gabriel's "
                 'first wife, Deborah. Many years ago, Florence had received a '
                 "letter from Deborah, telling of Deborah's suspicions of "
                 "Gabriel's infidelity. Deborah believed that Gabriel had had "
                 'an affair and fathered a child whom he had not claimed as '
                 'his own. Florence advised Deborah to confront Gabriel with '
                 'her suspicions and now wonders if she ever did. Florence '
                 'carries the letter in her purse, hoping that she will live '
                 "long enough to use the letter to bring about Gabriel's "
                 'destruction. She becomes suddenly angry with God that she is '
                 'dying while her brother is allowed to live and that their '
                 'dead mother will see her fall into Hell. Florence begins to '
                 'weep. In "Gabriel\'s Prayer," Gabriel hears his sister\'s '
                 'cry and is taken back to the morning he was saved: Dragging '
                 'himself home after a night of drinking and carousing, '
                 'Gabriel fell to the ground and experienced a religious '
                 "conversion. He began preaching, and after his mother's "
                 'death, the neighbor Deborah began to look after him, cooking '
                 'his meals and mending his clothes. There was to be a large '
                 'revival meeting during which 24 widely known and '
                 'well-respected ministers would meet and take turns '
                 'preaching. To his surprise and honor, Gabriel was invited to '
                 'be one of their number. On the final night, a banquet was '
                 'held during which one of the elder ministers mocked Deborah '
                 'for her rape (which occurred when she was 16) and her now '
                 'chaste life. Much offended, Gabriel chastised the man for '
                 'his lack of discretion. That evening Gabriel had two dreams '
                 'that he interpreted to mean that God intended for him to '
                 'marry Deborah. She tearfully accepted his proposal. Cries '
                 'from Elisha, who lies prone on the floor in religious '
                 'ecstasy, revive Gabriel from his memories. Gabriel, for a '
                 'moment, thinks that it is John on the floor. When he sees '
                 'that it is not, he is relieved but also bitter that neither '
                 'of his own sons are in the church with him: Roy is at home '
                 'wounded and angry, and the other child (Royal, whom Gabriel '
                 'never claimed as his son) is dead. Again Gabriel recalls the '
                 'past. Soon after Gabriel first began to preach, Ester came '
                 'to town with her mother and stepfather. Gabriel saw Ester as '
                 'sinful because every day after work a different boy escorted '
                 'Ester home. One day, Gabriel invited Ester to church on a '
                 "night that he was to speak. To everyone's surprise, Ester "
                 'and her mother attended the service that evening. Gabriel '
                 'preached a powerful sermon, one destined to be remembered '
                 'for many years to come. Nevertheless, Gabriel was angered '
                 'when his words did not draw Ester from her seat and to the '
                 "altar to ask for God's forgiveness and mercy. Soon after "
                 'this episode, Ester and Gabriel had a short-lived affair '
                 'during which Ester became pregnant. When she told Gabriel of '
                 'her condition, he initially denied that the child was his '
                 'and only agreed to help her after she threatened to tell the '
                 'community of his indiscretion. He gave Ester money that he '
                 'stole from Deborah, and Ester left for Chicago to have the '
                 'baby. Ester died in childbirth. Her body, as well as the '
                 'newborn Royal, was brought back by her grieving mother. '
                 'Gabriel never claimed the boy as his own. Many years later, '
                 'Deborah told him that Royal had been stabbed and killed in a '
                 'fight over a game of cards. Gabriel finally admitted to '
                 'Deborah that Royal was indeed his child. In "Elizabeth\'s '
                 'Prayer," Elizabeth recalls her childhood and how she came to '
                 'be where she is: Elizabeth was not very close to her mother, '
                 "but she adored her father. After her mother's death, "
                 "Elizabeth's maternal aunt took her away from her father, "
                 'claiming that he was incapable of raising a little girl. '
                 'Elizabeth never felt loved by her aunt and was very unhappy '
                 "growing up in her aunt's home. One summer, Elizabeth met "
                 'Richard, who was working as a clerk in a local store. Soon '
                 'the two developed a relationship and planned to marry. They '
                 'went to New York together where they both found work in the '
                 'same hotel. Their happiness continued until Richard was '
                 'arrested for a crime he did not commit. Although finally '
                 'found not guilty of the charge, Richard committed suicide '
                 'out of shame and humiliation. Elizabeth never had the chance '
                 'to tell him that she was pregnant with his child. Elizabeth '
                 'met Florence when they were both working as cleaning women '
                 'in the same office building. Both women shunned the company '
                 'of others but managed to become friends. Florence introduced '
                 'Elizabeth to Gabriel shortly after his arrival in the city. '
                 'Gabriel was very kind to Elizabeth and the infant John. '
                 "Despite Florence's objections, the two were soon married. "
                 'Elizabeth is brought back to the present by a cry from John. '
                 'He is lying on the floor overcome by the power of the Holy '
                 'Ghost. In Part Three, "The Threshing Floor," John\'s story '
                 'is told. Without knowing how he came to be there, John is '
                 'aware that he is lying on the church floor. He tries to rise '
                 'but finds himself unable to stand. He experiences several '
                 'visions culminating in a brief glimpse of God and his '
                 'rebirth into a new and holy life. After rising, John '
                 'approaches Gabriel, hoping that his experience will bring '
                 'the two of them together. It has just the opposite effect, '
                 'however, causing even more bitterness and resentment in '
                 'Gabriel. As the members of the church depart for home, '
                 "Florence confronts Gabriel with Deborah's letter and her "
                 'knowledge of his illegitimate son. Gabriel claims that he '
                 'has been forgiven by God and refuses to respond to his '
                 "sister's accusations. Florence promises to make the truth "
                 'known to Elizabeth and leaves for home. Elisha and John, who '
                 "are walking together, stop outside John's house. Elisha "
                 'gives John a few parting words of encouragement and advice '
                 'and also departs. John speaks words full of hope for the '
                 'future.',

{'author': 'William H. Hudson',
 'book_title': 'Green Mansions',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'A British official in Georgetown, British Guiana, after the '
                 'death of "Mr. Abel," feels compelled to publish the story of '
                 "his friend's adventures. He is, therefore, the narrator in "
                 'the prologue of Green Mansions. The Englishman explains how '
                 "he finally won Abel Guevez de Argensola's friendship so that "
                 'the latter revealed the secret of his mysterious past, of '
                 'the darkened chamber in his home, and of the urn containing '
                 'ashes. Throughout the twenty-two chapters of Green Mansions, '
                 'Abel himself narrates his story chronologically, and the '
                 'government official disappears completely from the plot. '
                 'Abel was twenty-three years old when he was about to flee '
                 'from Venezuela after the failure of a conspiracy to '
                 'overthrow the government. Abel, implicated in the abortive '
                 'coup, changed his mind about leaving the country and decided '
                 'instead to fulfill a boyhood dream of exploring the untamed '
                 'hinterlands south of the Orinoco river. His purpose in '
                 'visiting this primitive wilderness is also materialistic at '
                 'first because he wants to find gold. Suffering greatly from '
                 'the hardships of the terrain, Abel is further discouraged by '
                 'his realization that the natives have no golden objects in '
                 'their possession and that he is unable to discover any gold '
                 'deposits. Reaching an Indian village in the Parahuari '
                 'mountains, Abel is met by the natives and makes a favorable '
                 'impression on Runi, the chief, by a gift of a tinder-box, '
                 "his only remaining valuable trinket. Abel's welcome is then "
                 'made more generous by the Indians invitation to join in '
                 'drinking casserie, an alcoholic beverage. After this '
                 'initiation, Abel is hospitably accepted by all the '
                 "Parahuaris, especially Cla-cla, Runi's mother, and Kua-kó, a "
                 'young brave of the tribe. Abel gradually accepts his new way '
                 'of life and begins to appreciate the beauties of this wild '
                 'paradise of nature. After three weeks, Abel begins to '
                 'explore the forests alone. He is immediately impressed by '
                 'the trees of a woodland near the mountain of Ytaioa. The '
                 'trees become for Abel the "green mansions," where he is very '
                 'happy in the solitary natural surroundings. The Indians, '
                 "however, are not pleased by Abel's report of his visit to "
                 'the woodland; Runi, the chief, warns him not to go there '
                 'again. Abel is surprised that they never enter that '
                 'particular area to hunt or to roam. Fascinated by the '
                 'unknown and mysterious, Abel eagerly pays more visits to the '
                 '"green mansions" and is particularly delighted by the melody '
                 'of a bird whose sound somewhat resembles a human voice. '
                 'Kua-kó warns Abel that an evil spirit dwells in the '
                 'woodland, and the crafty savage begins to teach Abel the use '
                 'of the zabatana, the weapon through which the Parahuaris '
                 'blow poisoned arrows at game — and at their enemies. Abel, '
                 'after a short time, becomes aware of two related factors '
                 'shaping his future: An intelligent being lives in the '
                 'woodland, and the Parahuaris want him to kill the "daughter '
                 'of the Didi" with the blowpipe. During one of his frequent '
                 'excursions to the forest, Abel is about to kill a snake when '
                 'a beautiful young girl appears to protect the serpent. Abel '
                 'is astonished to observe the manner in which the snake '
                 'provides protection for the girl by curling itself around '
                 'one of her ankles. However, Abel forgets the snake as he '
                 'tries to approach the girl and is bitten by the serpent. '
                 'Fearing that he will soon die, Abel runs toward the Indian '
                 'village as a storm breaks. He loses his way, falls, and '
                 'loses consciousness. When he revives, Abel finds himself in '
                 'the hut of Nuflo, an old man, who says that Rima, the '
                 'bird-girl, is his granddaughter. The girl is shy indoors, '
                 'and Abel cannot associate his previous ecstatic impression '
                 'of her with the present surroundings. Although Rima is more '
                 'talkative in the woodland, she continues to be shy with Abel '
                 'as he endeavors to express his love to her. Nuflo and Abel, '
                 'though they do not quarrel openly, nevertheless challenge '
                 'each other in their constant discussions: The old man is '
                 'reluctant to talk about his background and that of Rima, and '
                 "Abel is constantly asking questions about the pair's past. "
                 "Abel also discovers that Nuflo, contrary to Rima's wishes, "
                 'kills animals in order to enjoy the taste of meat. Irked by '
                 "Rima's avoidance of his presence, Abel leaves the woodland "
                 'to spend a few days with the Parahuaris. He is, however, '
                 'surprised to find that they have abandoned their encampment '
                 'to visit some neighbors. Only Cla-cla, too feeble for the '
                 'rigors of the trip, remains behind, and she and Abel enjoy '
                 "an evening by the fire singing and talking. Abel's anger at "
                 "Rima's strange rebuffs disappears soon, and he hastens back "
                 'to the "green mansions" to see Rima despite Cla-cla\'s pleas '
                 'to stay at the Parahuari village. Caught again in a storm '
                 'after going in the wrong direction, Abel is saved by Rima, '
                 'who has been faithfully waiting in the woodland for him to '
                 'return. Rima, though she is still unable to declare her '
                 'obvious love for Abel, is more communicative with the young '
                 'man, and they spend a day on top of Ytaioa mountain. Abel '
                 'tries to tell the girl about the vast territories of the '
                 'outside world, and he stresses the inner peace existing in '
                 'the isolated "green mansions." Rima, however, is curious to '
                 'know at first hand the sights beyond the woodland. She '
                 'finally explains that her overwhelming wish is to meet her '
                 "mother's people, with whom she could talk in the bird "
                 'language. Despite his effort to explain gently the truth '
                 'about the probable annihilation of her tribe, Abel by chance '
                 'mentions the mountains of Riolama, which Rima recognizes as '
                 'the place where her mother belonged. She goes down Ytaioa '
                 'quickly to upbraid Nuflo for concealing the location of '
                 'Riolama and to make plans for a journey there. Abel '
                 'sorrowfully follows Rima because he fears that the idyll of '
                 'the "green mansions" is ending or, at least, is facing a '
                 "crisis. Nuflo is furious at Abel's mention of Riolama, but "
                 "the old man, through fear of Rima's prayers about his future "
                 'salvation, is forced to undertake the trip. In return for '
                 'his part in the expedition, Abel demands that Nuflo tell the '
                 "truth about his and Rima's background. Visiting the "
                 'Parahuaris to divert any possible suspicion from the savages '
                 'about the planned absence from the woodland, Abel is treated '
                 'as a prisoner, and he has to escape from the village to '
                 'rejoin his two companions. During the trip to Riolama, Nuflo '
                 'gradually reveals to Abel the story of his relationship with '
                 'Rima. Nuflo, a member of a band of outlaws, by chance met an '
                 'injured woman who was pregnant. He took her to the '
                 'settlement of Voa where her daughter, Rima, was born. The '
                 'child, like the mother, spoke a mysterious language of the '
                 'birds which Nuflo was unable to understand. When the mother '
                 'died, Nuflo took Rima to the "green mansions," and the girl, '
                 'sickly because of the climate at Voa, became healthy as she '
                 'lived close to nature. Rima, protecting the forest life, is '
                 'hated by the Indians because she prevents them from killing '
                 'the birds and animals. When the party reaches Riolama, Abel '
                 "tries to explain to Rima that the girl's tribe was probably "
                 'killed by warring natives and that her mother was the only '
                 'survivor. Rinia, overcome emotionally by the explanation of '
                 'the tragedy, faints. She turns to Abel for love and '
                 'protection when she revives. Instead of going back to the '
                 '"green mansions" with Nuflo and Abel, the girl determines to '
                 'return alone in order to prepare clothes for herself and a '
                 'more suitable welcome for Abel. Stunned by this sudden '
                 "decision, Abel reacts too slowly to stop the girl's "
                 'departure. Abel and Nuflo start back on the difficult trip, '
                 "and they immediately suspect disaster when Nuflo's hut is "
                 'found burned to the ground. Searching for Rima in the '
                 'woodland, Abel is more apprehensive when one of the Indians, '
                 'who have never dared to enter the "green mansions," appears '
                 'and confidently leads him to the Parahuari village. After '
                 'Runi berates Abel before the other savages, the young man '
                 'explains convincingly that he had only left the encampment '
                 'to search for gold. Abel eventually persuades Kua-kó to '
                 'explain what happened to Rima. The Parahuaris, realizing '
                 'that the woodland was no longer protected by Rima, began to '
                 'hunt in the territory. One day they trapped the returning '
                 'Rima in a tree. They built a fire around the tree, and Rima '
                 'plunged to her death in the flames, calling to Abel as she '
                 'fell. Unable to sleep after hearing the tragic story, Abel '
                 'tries to run away from the natives; but Kua-kó pursues him, '
                 'and Abel kills the savage. Abel goes to the camp of Managa, '
                 "Runi's enemy, and leads these Indians on a massacre of the "
                 "Parahuaris. The sight of the dead Cla-cla revives Abel's "
                 "better instincts, and he escapes to Nuflo's hideaway, where "
                 'he finds the old man slain by the marauding savages. Abel '
                 'endeavors to live alone, but he realizes that he will go '
                 'insane because of the memories of Rima associated with the '
                 '"green mansions." He searches for and finds the remains of '
                 'Rima, determined to return to civilization where he can do '
                 'silent homage to Rima for the rest of his life. Although '
                 'Abel is weak and the trip is long, he finally reaches '
                 'Georgetown, where he recovers and establishes himself as a '
                 'respectable figure, but one of mysterious, unexplained '
                 'origins.',

 'summary_text': "Gulliver's Travels is an adventure story (in reality, a "
                 'misadventure story) involving several voyages of Lemuel '
                 "Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, who, because of a series of "
                 'mishaps en route to recognized ports, ends up, instead, on '
                 'several unknown islands living with people and animals of '
                 'unusual sizes, behaviors, and philosophies, but who, after '
                 'each adventure, is somehow able to return to his home in '
                 'England where he recovers from these unusual experiences and '
                 'then sets out again on a new voyage. Book I: When the ship '
                 'Gulliver is traveling on is destroyed in a storm, Gulliver '
                 'ends up on the island of Lilliput, where he awakes to find '
                 'that he has been captured by Lilliputians, very small people '
                 '— approximately six inches in height. Gulliver is treated '
                 'with compassion and concern. In turn, he helps them solve '
                 'some of their problems, especially their conflict with their '
                 'enemy, Blefuscu, an island across the bay from them. '
                 'Gulliver falls from favor, however, because he refuses to '
                 "support the Emperor's desire to enslave the Blefuscudians "
                 'and because he "makes water" to put out a palace fire. '
                 'Gulliver flees to Blefuscu, where he converts a large war '
                 'ship to his own use and sets sail from Blefuscu eventually '
                 'to be rescued at sea by an English merchant ship and '
                 'returned to his home in England. Book II: As he travels as a '
                 "ship's surgeon, Gulliver and a small crew are sent to find "
                 'water on an island. Instead they encounter a land of giants. '
                 'As the crew flees, Gulliver is left behind and captured. '
                 "Gulliver's captor, a farmer, takes him to the farmer's home "
                 'where Gulliver is treated kindly, but, of course, curiously. '
                 'The farmer assigns his daughter, Glumdalclitch, to be '
                 "Gulliver's keeper, and she cares for Gulliver with great "
                 'compassion. The farmer takes Gulliver on tour across the '
                 'countryside, displaying him to onlookers. Eventually, the '
                 'farmer sells Gulliver to the Queen. At court, Gulliver meets '
                 'the King, and the two spend many sessions discussing the '
                 "customs and behaviors of Gulliver's country. In many cases, "
                 'the King is shocked and chagrined by the selfishness and '
                 'pettiness that he hears Gulliver describe. Gulliver, on the '
                 'other hand, defends England. One day, on the beach, as '
                 'Gulliver looks longingly at the sea from his box (portable '
                 'room), he is snatched up by an eagle and eventually dropped '
                 'into the sea. A passing ship spots the floating chest and '
                 'rescues Gulliver, eventually returning him to England and '
                 'his family. Book III: Gulliver is on a ship bound for the '
                 'Levant. After arriving, Gulliver is assigned captain of a '
                 'sloop to visit nearby islands and establish trade. On this '
                 'trip, pirates attack the sloop and place Gulliver in a small '
                 'boat to fend for himself. While drifting at sea, Gulliver '
                 'discovers a Flying Island. While on the Flying Island, '
                 'called Laputa, Gulliver meets several inhabitants, including '
                 'the King. All are preoccupied with things associated with '
                 'mathematics and music. In addition, astronomers use the laws '
                 'of magnetism to move the island up, down, forward, backward, '
                 "and sideways, thus controlling the island's movements in "
                 'relation to the island below (Balnibarbi). While in this '
                 'land, Gulliver visits Balnibarbi, the island of '
                 'Glubbdubdrib, and Luggnagg. Gulliver finally arrives in '
                 'Japan where he meets the Japanese emperor. From there, he '
                 'goes to Amsterdam and eventually home to England. Book IV: '
                 'While Gulliver is captain of a merchant ship bound for '
                 'Barbados and the Leeward Islands, several of his crew become '
                 'ill and die on the voyage. Gulliver hires several '
                 'replacement sailors in Barbados. These replacements turn out '
                 'to be pirates who convince the other crew members to mutiny. '
                 'As a result, Gulliver is deposited on a "strand" (an island) '
                 'to fend for himself. Almost immediately, he is discovered by '
                 'a herd of ugly, despicable human-like creatures who are '
                 'called, he later learns, Yahoos. They attack him by climbing '
                 'trees and defecating on him. He is saved from this disgrace '
                 'by the appearance of a horse, identified, he later learns, '
                 'by the name Houyhnhnm. The grey horse (a Houyhnhnm) takes '
                 "Gulliver to his home, where he is introduced to the grey's "
                 'mare (wife), a colt and a foal (children), and a sorrel nag '
                 '(the servant). Gulliver also sees that the Yahoos are kept '
                 'in pens away from the house. It becomes immediately clear '
                 "that, except for Gulliver's clothing, he and the Yahoos are "
                 'the same animal. From this point on, Gulliver and his master '
                 '(the grey) begin a series of discussions about the evolution '
                 'of Yahoos, about topics, concepts, and behaviors related to '
                 'the Yahoo society, which Gulliver represents, and about the '
                 'society of the Houyhnhnms. Despite his favored treatment in '
                 "the grey steed's home, the kingdom's Assembly determines "
                 'that Gulliver is a Yahoo and must either live with the '
                 'uncivilized Yahoos or return to his own world. With great '
                 'sadness, Gulliver takes his leave of the Houyhnhnms. He '
                 'builds a canoe and sails to a nearby island where he is '
                 'eventually found hiding by a crew from a Portuguese ship. '
                 "The ship's captain returns Gulliver to Lisbon, where he "
                 "lives in the captain's home. Gulliver is so repelled by the "
                 'sight and smell of these "civilized Yahoos" that he can\'t '
                 'stand to be around them. Eventually, however, Gulliver '
                 'agrees to return to his family in England. Upon his arrival, '
                 'he is repelled by his Yahoo family, so he buys two horses '
                 'and spends most of his days caring for and conversing with '
                 'the horses in the stable in order to be as far away from his '
                 'Yahoo family as possible.',

{'author': 'Lois Lowry',
 'book_title': 'The Giver',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Lowry narrates The Giver in third person ("He said," as '
                 'opposed to "I said," which is called first person), using a '
                 "limited omniscient viewpoint (only Jonas' thoughts and "
                 "feelings are revealed). Through Jonas' eyes, his community "
                 'appears to be a utopia — a perfect place — that is '
                 'self-contained and isolated from Elsewhere, every other '
                 'place in the world. No evidence of disease, hunger, poverty, '
                 "war, or lasting pain exists in the community. Jonas' family, "
                 'like all other families in the community, includes a caring '
                 'mother and father and two children — one male child and one '
                 "female child. Jonas' mother has an important job with the "
                 'Department of Justice, and his father has a job as a '
                 'Nurturer, taking care of newborns. Jonas has one younger '
                 'sister, Lily. His family seems ideal. Each morning, they '
                 'discuss their dreams that they had the previous night; '
                 'during the evening meal, they share feelings about the '
                 'events of the day, comforting and supporting each other '
                 'according to the rules of the community. As we learn more '
                 "about Jonas' family, we also learn about the community as a "
                 'whole. Family units must apply for children, spouses do not '
                 'get to choose one another but, instead, are matched, and '
                 'grandparents do not exist. All of a sudden, this utopia that '
                 "Lowry has created doesn't seem quite right. The mood is "
                 'foreboding, a feeling that something bad will happen. This '
                 "mood suggests that Jonas' community is far from perfect. A "
                 "long time ago, the people in Jonas' community chose to have "
                 'the community ruled by a Committee of Elders. The Committee '
                 'of Elders controls everyone and everything, blasting rules '
                 'and reprimands from loudspeakers located throughout the '
                 'community, including in every family dwelling. A total of '
                 'fifty infants are born to Birthmothers every year. Each peer '
                 'group is identified by its age — for example, Threes, '
                 'Sevens, Nines — and must follow specific rules about '
                 'appropriate clothing, haircuts, and activities for that '
                 'particular peer group. When children become Eights, they '
                 'begin mandatory volunteering and are closely observed by the '
                 'Committee of Elders so that the committee can assign a '
                 'lifelong profession to each child at the Ceremony of Twelve, '
                 'which takes place every year during the December Ceremony. '
                 "The Giver begins with Jonas' apprehension about his Ceremony "
                 'of Twelve, when he will be assigned his lifelong job. He can '
                 'guess which jobs his friends, Fiona and Asher, will be '
                 'assigned, but he has no idea what his own job Assignment '
                 'will be. At the Ceremony, Jonas learns that he has been '
                 'selected to become the next Receiver of Memory, the highest '
                 'position in the community. Jonas begins training under the '
                 'present Receiver of Memory, an older man whom Jonas calls '
                 'The Giver. The Giver lives alone in private rooms that are '
                 "lined with shelves full of books. Jonas' training involves "
                 'receiving, from The Giver, all of the emotions and memories '
                 'of experiences that the people in the community chose to '
                 'give up to attain Sameness and the illusion of social order. '
                 'The first memory that Jonas receives from The Giver is a '
                 'sled ride down a snow-covered hill. Jonas has never before '
                 'experienced going downhill, cold weather, or snow. '
                 'Eventually, through memories, The Giver teaches Jonas about '
                 'color, love, war, and pain. Jonas begins to understand the '
                 'hypocrisy that exists in his community — that is, the '
                 'illusion that everything in the community is good when in '
                 "fact it isn't. The people appear to love each other, but "
                 "they don't really know what love feels like because their "
                 'lives are a charade; their reactions have been trained. '
                 'Jonas realizes that people have given up their freedoms to '
                 'feel and think as individuals, choosing instead to be '
                 'controlled by others. One day, Jonas asks The Giver if he '
                 'can watch a video of a release his father performed on an '
                 'infant earlier that morning. He watches and is horrified '
                 'when he realizes that a release is really forced death by '
                 'lethal injection. Jonas discusses his feelings with The '
                 'Giver, and they decide on a plan that will force the people '
                 'to give up Sameness. However, before they can carry out '
                 'their plan, Jonas learns that Gabriel, a two-year-old infant '
                 "who has been staying with Jonas' family unit because Gabriel "
                 'has trouble sleeping through the night, is going to be '
                 'released — killed. To prevent Gabriel from being killed, '
                 'Jonas takes Gabriel, whom he loves, and together they ride a '
                 'bicycle out of the community to Elsewhere. By escaping the '
                 'community, all of the memories that Jonas has received from '
                 'The Giver will be transmitted back to the citizens in the '
                 'community, forcing them to experience feelings and emotions '
                 'and to remember their past. Jonas travels for days and days '
                 'with Gabriel, who is dying from starvation and the cold '
                 'weather. Finally, they come to the top of a hill where there '
                 'is snow and a sled. They get on the sled and ride downhill '
                 'toward music and Christmas lights. What actually happens to '
                 'Jonas and Gabriel? Do they die? Are they dreaming? Do they '
                 'go to a house with lights and music? Do they end up back in '
                 'their original community? Do the people in the community '
                 'change? All of these questions are left unanswered at the '
                 'end of the book. Lowry intentionally writes an ambiguous '
                 'ending so that readers can decide for themselves what '
                 'happens to Jonas and Gabriel at the end of The Giver .',

 'summary_text': 'In the Wingfield apartment in St. Louis, the mother, Amanda, '
                 'lives with her crippled daughter and her working son, Tom. '
                 'At dinner she tells her daughter, Laura, to stay nice and '
                 'pretty for her gentlemen callers even though Laura has never '
                 'had any callers and expects none. Amanda remembers the time '
                 'that she had seventeen gentlemen callers all on one Sunday '
                 'afternoon. Amanda then tells Laura to practice her shorthand '
                 "and typing. A few days later Amanda comes home from Laura's "
                 'school after finding out that Laura had dropped out several '
                 'months earlier. Amanda is shocked and wonders what they will '
                 'do with their lives since Laura refuses to try to help and '
                 'spends all her time playing with her glass menagerie and her '
                 'old phonograph records. Amanda decides that they must have a '
                 'gentleman caller for Laura, and Laura tells her that she has '
                 'liked only one boy in her whole life, a high school boy '
                 'named Jim. When Tom goes out to the movies that night, '
                 'Amanda accuses him of doing something else rather than going '
                 'to the movies every night. They have an argument, and the '
                 'next morning after Tom apologizes, Amanda asks him to find '
                 'some nice gentleman caller for Laura and to bring him home '
                 'for dinner. A few days later, Tom tells Amanda that he has '
                 "invited a young man named Jim O'Connor home for dinner. "
                 'Amanda immediately begins to make rather elaborate plans for '
                 'the gentleman caller. On the next night, Amanda oversees '
                 'Laura\'s dress and adds some "gay deceivers" to the dress to '
                 'make Laura more attractive. When she mentions the name of '
                 'the gentleman caller, Laura realizes that it is possibly the '
                 'same Jim on whom she had a crush in high school. She tells '
                 'her mother that she might not be able to come for dinner if '
                 'it is the same one. Amanda will have nothing to do with such '
                 'foolishness, and even though Laura is sick when the '
                 'gentleman caller arrives, Amanda forces her to open the '
                 'door. And it is the Jim that she knew from high school. At '
                 'dinner she is physically sick and has to be excused. Later, '
                 'Amanda sends Jim, the gentleman caller, into the living room '
                 'to keep Laura company while she and Tom do the dishes. As '
                 'Jim and Laura talk, she loses some of her shyness and '
                 "becomes rather charming. Jim is attracted by Laura's quiet "
                 'charms, but later after having kissed her, he must explain '
                 'that he is already engaged. When Amanda reappears, Jim '
                 'explains to her also that he is engaged and must go. Amanda '
                 'is so stunned that she accuses Tom of deliberately playing a '
                 'trick on them. The play ends with Tom some years in the '
                 'future thinking back on his sister Laura whom he can never '
                 'forget.',

 'summary_text': "The novel opens on Wang Lung's wedding day. Wang is a "
                 'Chinese peasant farmer who lives with his father; his mother '
                 'died six years earlier. His intended bride, O-lan, is a '
                 'slave in the prosperous House of Hwang. Wang walks to the '
                 'House of Hwang, where he is embarrassed by his shabby '
                 'appearance, and collects O-lan after appearing before the '
                 "Ancient Mistress of the House. The couple returns to Wang's "
                 'farm, where O-lan prepares dinner for guests — including '
                 "Wang's unnamed uncle and the uncle's unnamed son — invited "
                 'to celebrate the wedding. Later that night, Wang and O-lan '
                 'consummate their marriage. Over the next few months '
                 'following their marriage, O-lan tends the house and joins '
                 'Wang in cultivating the fields. We learn at the end of '
                 'Chapter 2 that she is pregnant. The events of her pregnancy '
                 'are skipped over, and we soon find O-lan ready to deliver '
                 'her baby; she asks Wang for nothing except a newly peeled '
                 "reed, slit, so that she may cut the baby's umbilical cord. "
                 'She delivers a son and soon rejoins Wang in working the '
                 'fields. The harvest is prosperous, and Wang and O-lan are '
                 'able to hide silver dollars from the harvest in their house. '
                 'On the second day of the New Year, Wang and O-lan, dressed '
                 'in new clothes that O-lan has sewed, take their son to the '
                 'House of Hwang to present him to the Ancient Mistress. Their '
                 "appearance of prosperity is in stark contrast to Wang's "
                 'appearance the first time he visited the House. O-lan '
                 'relates to Wang her suspicion that the great House of Hwang '
                 'is having financial difficulties, so much so that the House '
                 'is looking to sell a portion of its land. With the silver '
                 'coins from their previous harvest, Wang purchases the land. '
                 'Soon thereafter, O-lan delivers a second son. Along with '
                 'this second son comes another prosperous harvest, even '
                 'better than before, and Wang and O-lan again are able to '
                 'stash silver in their house. At the same time that O-lan is '
                 "delivering yet another child — a girl this time — Wang's "
                 'uncle approaches Wang and cajoles Wang into giving him '
                 'silver to be used as a dowry for his eldest daughter. Wang '
                 'resists giving the money to his uncle, who is a despicable '
                 'character, but out of guilt — and the threat of blackmail of '
                 'his good name — Wang acquiesces. Times grow bad for Wang and '
                 'the other farmers, but he continues to buy land from the '
                 "House of Hwang — although he does not tell O-lan that he's "
                 'using up all of their silver. Food grows scarce, and the '
                 "family is forced to slaughter their ox and eat it. Wang's "
                 'uncle maliciously spreads the false rumor among the farmers '
                 'and villagers that Wang has hordes of food and silver, and '
                 "men force their way into Wang's home and take what little "
                 'food they find, to which Wang comforts himself by saying '
                 'that at least no one can take the land that he owns. Wang '
                 'decides to move his family in hopes of finding a job, but he '
                 'refuses to sell his land. Along with many others, Wang and '
                 'his family take a train south. Arriving in an unnamed city '
                 'in the south, Wang and his family support themselves by '
                 'O-lan and the children begging for food and Wang hiring '
                 'himself out as a ricksha driver. Daily they eat at the '
                 'public kitchens. Soon, armed soldiers regularly appear in '
                 'the city, for there is talk of war; the rich begin fleeing '
                 'the city, abandoning their opulent houses. A mob of people '
                 'including Wang break into one of these abandoned houses, and '
                 'Wang forces a man who failed to flee the house to give him '
                 'gold. With this gold, Wang and his family return to their '
                 'land and once again establish themselves as prosperous '
                 'farmers. Wang learns from O-lan that while in the southern '
                 'city she stole a cache of jewels from the house where Wang '
                 'stole the gold. With this newfound prosperity, Wang buys up '
                 'all of the remaining land of the House of Hwang. He is '
                 'becoming as rich and established as the House of Hwang '
                 'formerly was. Seven years pass of increased fortune, but in '
                 'that seventh year a great flood comes and covers the fields. '
                 "With idle time on his hands, Wang begins visiting the town's "
                 'tea shop. There, he is introduced to a woman named Lotus '
                 'Flower and takes her for his concubine, moving her and her '
                 'servant into his house. The household further grows when '
                 "Wang's uncle and aunt and their son forcibly move themselves "
                 "into Wang's house. Additionally, Wang's sons marry, and they "
                 'and their families live in the house. It is during this time '
                 "that O-lan and Wang's elderly father both die and are "
                 "buried. Wang's oldest son approaches his father and suggests "
                 'that the family move into town, into the great house '
                 'formerly occupied by the House of Hwang. Wang likes this '
                 "idea, and the entire family — except Wang's uncle and aunt — "
                 "move; Wang's uncle's son goes to join the war. The House of "
                 'Hwang has now become the House of Lung. Wang spends less '
                 'time surveying his many lands, and he begins renting some of '
                 'his lands to tenants — just as the Old Lord of the House of '
                 "Hwang had done. It is during this time that Wang's uncle "
                 'dies, and Wang moves his aunt into the house in town. As '
                 'Wang grows older, he becomes less attracted to Lotus Flower '
                 'and finds that his affection for a slave named Pear Blossom '
                 'increases. Ultimately, he takes Pear Blossom as his new '
                 'concubine. His passion for her soon wanes, but he remains '
                 'fond of her. He, Pear Blossom, and his first daughter return '
                 'to the house on the land. His two oldest sons visit him, and '
                 'they promise him that they will never sell the land — but it '
                 'is clear that they are lying, and that they eventually will '
                 'sell the land once Wang dies.',

 'summary_text': 'In Depression-era Oklahoma, Tom Joad hitchhikes home after '
                 'being paroled from the state penitentiary. Along the road, '
                 'he encounters Jim Casy, a preacher Tom remembers from '
                 'childhood. Casy explains that he is no longer a preacher, '
                 'having lost his calling. He still believes in the Holy '
                 'Spirit, but not necessarily the spirituality mandated by '
                 'organized religion. For Casy, the Holy Spirit is love. Not '
                 'just the love of God or Jesus, but the love of all humans. '
                 'He maintains that all people are holy, everyone being part '
                 'of the whole soul of humankind. Tom invites Casy to join him '
                 'on his walk home. When they arrive at what was once the Joad '
                 'farm, Tom and Casy find it abandoned. Muley Graves, a Joad '
                 'neighbor, approaches and tells Tom that his family has been '
                 'tractored off their land by the bank. They have moved in '
                 'with his Uncle John and are preparing to leave for '
                 'California to find work. Tom and Casy spend the night near '
                 "the deserted farm and head to Uncle John's early the next "
                 'morning. The family is preparing for their journey to '
                 'California when Tom and Casy arrive. Casy asks whether he '
                 'can journey west with the Joads. The Joads agree to take him '
                 'along. Once their belongings have been sold, everyone except '
                 'Granpa is anxious to get started. They pack the truck, but '
                 'Granpa has decided he wants to stay on the land, and they '
                 'must drug Granpa in order to get him in the truck. They are '
                 'on the highway by dawn. The family stops that first evening '
                 'next to a migrant couple whose car has broken down. The '
                 'Wilsons are gracious, offering their tent to Granpa who has '
                 "a stroke and dies. Tom and Al fix the Wilson's car, and the "
                 'two families decide to travel together. In New Mexico, the '
                 "Wilson's touring car breaks down again, and the families are "
                 'forced to stop. Granma has become increasingly ill since '
                 "Granpa's death, and Tom suggests the others take the truck "
                 'and continue on. Ma refuses to go, insisting that the family '
                 'stay together. She picks up the jack handle to support her '
                 'point, and the rest of the family gives in. As they reach '
                 'the desert bordering California, Sairy Wilson becomes so ill '
                 'that she is unable to continue. The Joads leave the Wilsons '
                 'and continue across the California desert on their own. '
                 "Granma's health continues to deteriorate, and as the truck "
                 'starts its nighttime trek across the desert, Ma knows that '
                 'Granma will not survive. Knowing that they cannot afford to '
                 'stop, Ma lies in the back of the truck with Granma. Midway '
                 'across the desert, Granma dies. By dawn, the Joads have '
                 'climbed out of the desert and stop the truck to gaze down '
                 'upon the beautiful Bakersfield valley. Ma tells them that '
                 'Granma has passed. She must be buried a pauper because the '
                 'family does not have enough money to bury her. The Joads '
                 'stop at the first camp they come to, a dirty Hooverville of '
                 'tents and makeshift shelters. The men are talking to Floyd '
                 'Knowles, a young man in the camp, when a businessman '
                 'accompanied by a cop offers them work. When Floyd asks for a '
                 'wage offer in writing, he is accused of being a "red," and '
                 'the cop attempts to arrest him. Tom trips the cop, and Casy '
                 'kicks him. When the cop regains consciousness, Casy gives '
                 'himself up to the law in order to divert attention away from '
                 'Tom. The Joads immediately leave to avoid any further '
                 'trouble. The Joads travel south to a government-run camp in '
                 'Weedpatch. Here, the community governs itself, electing '
                 'committees to deal with clean-up, discipline, and '
                 'entertainment. The Joads are comfortable but, after a month, '
                 'are still unable to find any work and realize they must move '
                 'on. They are offered work picking peaches in Tulare. The '
                 'camp gate is surrounded by a large group of men shouting and '
                 'waving. The Joads, escorted through the gate by state '
                 'police, begin work immediately. They are paid five cents a '
                 "box, not sufficient to feed the family a day's meal. After "
                 'the first day of picking, Tom wanders outside the ranch. He '

 'summary_text': 'Prince Hamlet is depressed. Having been summoned home to '
                 "Denmark from school in Germany to attend his father's "
                 'funeral, he is shocked to find his mother Gertrude already '
                 "remarried. The Queen has wed Hamlet's Uncle Claudius , the "
                 'dead king\'s brother. To Hamlet, the marriage is "foul '
                 'incest." Worse still, Claudius has had himself crowned King '
                 "despite the fact that Hamlet was his father's heir to the "
                 "throne. Hamlet suspects foul play. When his father's ghost "
                 "visits the castle, Hamlet's suspicions are confirmed. The "
                 'Ghost complains that he is unable to rest in peace because '
                 'he was murdered. Claudius, says the Ghost, poured poison in '
                 "King Hamlet's ear while the old king napped. Unable to "
                 'confess and find salvation, King Hamlet is now consigned, '
                 'for a time, to spend his days in Purgatory and walk the '
                 'earth by night. He entreats Hamlet to avenge his death, but '
                 'to spare Gertrude, to let Heaven decide her fate. Hamlet '
                 'vows to affect madness — puts "an antic disposition on" — to '
                 'wear a mask that will enable him to observe the interactions '
                 'in the castle, but finds himself more confused than ever. In '
                 "his persistent confusion, he questions the Ghost's "
                 'trustworthiness. What if the Ghost is not a true spirit, but '
                 'rather an agent of the devil sent to tempt him? What if '
                 "killing Claudius results in Hamlet's having to relive his "
                 'memories for all eternity? Hamlet agonizes over what he '
                 'perceives as his cowardice because he cannot stop himself '
                 'from thinking. Words immobilize Hamlet, but the world he '
                 "lives in prizes action. In order to test the Ghost's "
                 'sincerity, Hamlet enlists the help of a troupe of players '
                 'who perform a play called The Murder of Gonzago to which '
                 'Hamlet has added scenes that recreate the murder the Ghost '
                 'described. Hamlet calls the revised play The Mousetrap, and '
                 "the ploy proves a success. As Hamlet had hoped, Claudius' "
                 'reaction to the staged murder reveals the King to be '
                 'conscience-stricken. Claudius leaves the room because he '
                 'cannot breathe, and his vision is dimmed for want of light. '
                 'Convinced now that Claudius is a villain, Hamlet resolves to '
                 'kill him. But, as Hamlet observes, "conscience doth make '
                 'cowards of us all." In his continued reluctance to dispatch '
                 'Claudius, Hamlet actually causes six ancillary deaths. The '
                 'first death belongs to Polonius , whom Hamlet stabs through '
                 'a wallhanging as the old man spies on Hamlet and Gertrude in '
                 "the Queen's private chamber. Claudius punishes Hamlet for "
                 "Polonius' death by exiling him to England. He has brought "
                 "Hamlet's school chums Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to "
                 'Denmark from Germany to spy on his nephew, and now he '
                 "instructs them to deliver Hamlet into the English king's "
                 'hands for execution. Hamlet discovers the plot and arranges '
                 'for the hanging of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. '
                 "Ophelia , distraught over her father's death and Hamlet's "
                 'behavior, drowns while singing sad love songs bemoaning the '
                 'fate of a spurned lover. Her brother, Laertes , falls next. '
                 'Laertes, returned to Denmark from France to avenge his '
                 "father's death, witnesses Ophelia's descent into madness. "
                 'After her funeral, where he and Hamlet come to blows over '
                 'which of them loved Ophelia best, Laertes vows to punish '
                 'Hamlet for her death as well. Unencumbered by words, Laertes '
                 'plots with Claudius to kill Hamlet. In the midst of the '
                 'sword fight, however, Laertes drops his poisoned sword. '
                 'Hamlet retrieves the sword and cuts Laertes. The lethal '
                 'poison kills Laertes. Before he dies, Laertes tells Hamlet '
                 'that because Hamlet has already been cut with the same '
                 "sword, he too will shortly die. Horatio diverts Hamlet's "
                 'attention from Laertes for a moment by pointing out that '
                 '"The Queen falls." Gertrude, believing that Hamlet\'s '
                 'hitting Laertes means her son is winning the fencing match, '
                 'has drunk a toast to her son from the poisoned cup Claudius '
                 'had intended for Hamlet. The Queen dies. As Laertes lies '
                 'dying, he confesses to Hamlet his part in the plot and '
                 "explains that Gertrude's death lies on Claudius' head. "
                 'Finally enraged, Hamlet stabs Claudius with the poisoned '
                 'sword and then pours the last of the poisoned wine down the '
                 "King's throat. Before he dies, Hamlet declares that the "
                 'throne should now pass to Prince Fortinbras of Norway, and '
                 'he implores his true friend Horatio to accurately explain '
                 'the events that have led to the bloodbath at Elsinore. With '
                 'his last breath, he releases himself from the prison of his '
                 'words: "The rest is silence." The play ends as Prince '
                 'Fortinbras, in his first act as King of Denmark, orders a '
                 'funeral with full military honors for slain Prince Hamlet.',

 'summary_text': 'As indicated at the close of Henry IV, Part II, King Henry V '
                 'is planning on entering into a war with France over some '
                 'disputed lands and titles. He has instructed the Archbishop '
                 'to be sure that his claims are valid. When the play opens, '

                 'court is contemptuous of his claims and of his abilities. '
                 'They are so overconfident that they do not send help to the '

                 'necessity to learn the English language, and so she begins '
                 'taking instructions in that language. Meanwhile, the reports '

                 'can find some shelter under trees. Miss Sasaki spends days '
                 'and hours in the debris, but she is finally rescued although '
                 'semi-conscious and in pain and left in a lean-to. Father '
                 'Kleinsorge helps those trapped under houses and makes his '
                 'way to Asano Park along with Mr. Tanimoto. Both ministers '
                 'help people in the park put out fires and get medical help. '
                 'During the evening of August 6, the survivors struggle to '
                 'endure and help each other. The city is a ball of flame, and '
                 'the park is filled with radiation rain and whirlwinds. The '
                 'suffering of thousands of people and their wounds and burns '
                 'are described repeatedly. Mr. Tanimoto must remind himself '
                 'that these creatures are human beings. Relentlessly, he '
                 'ferries boatloads of people upstream to get to higher '
                 'ground. Several injured priests and the Nakamura family are '
                 'evacuated to the Novitiate in the hills. The injured and '
                 'dying are so numerous that the doctors no longer help the '
                 'badly injured because they are not going to survive. Miss '
                 'Sasaki is finally evacuated and begins many days and weeks '
                 'of being moved from one hospital or aid station to another. '
                 'As time goes by, order is slowly restored, but the '
                 'overwhelming scene of misery and human suffering is a sharp '
                 'counterpoint to the official news released from various '
                 'governments. On August 9, a second bomb is dropped, this '
                 'time on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. On August 15, the '
                 'Emperor of Japan gives a radio address telling his people '
                 'that Japan has surrendered. Next, the horrible revelations '
                 'of radiation illness commence. Dr. Kleinsorge must go to a '
                 'hospital in Tokyo. He will never again regain his energy or '
                 'health. Miss Sasaki, also in a hospital, is so depressed '
                 'over being crippled for the rest of her life that her doctor '
                 'asks Father Kleinsorge to visit her. Dr. Sasaki spends '
                 'months and years analyzing the effects of the radiation and '
                 'how best to treat it; he marries and begins a medical '
                 'practice. Dr. Fujii also opens a medical practice and begins '
                 'socializing with the occupation officers. Mrs. Nakamura and '
                 'her children lose their hair and suffer from various '
                 'illnesses, but because they are so poor, they cannot afford '
                 'to see a doctor. Mr. Tanimoto attempts to operate his church '
                 'out of his badly destroyed home. The survivors struggle on '
                 'with the effects of the radiation, and attempt to find ways '
                 'to manage despite their injuries. A fifth chapter, "The '
                 'Aftermath," was added later, detailing the lives of the '
                 'survivors after the bombing (up to 1985). Mrs. Nakamura is '
                 'receiving medical help for her many radiation illnesses and '
                 'staying away from political rallies by the survivors, who '
                 'are now called "hibakusha." The hibakusha have become the '
                 "targets of politics and the peace movement. Mrs. Nakamura's "
                 'children are grown, and she has retired from a job at a '
                 'chemical company. Dr. Sasaki ran a lucrative medical '
                 'practice. He lost his wife to cancer, and he is still '
                 'haunted by the souls of those who died as a result of the '
                 'bombing. Father Kleinsorge spent many years ill, both in and '
                 'out of the hospital. In 1976, he slipped and fell on ice, '
                 'resulting in fractures that left him bedridden. The '
                 'following year he weakened, became comatose, and died. Miss '
                 'Sasaki endured numerous surgeries on her leg. She converted '
                 'to Catholicism and became a nun, helping people die in '
                 'peace. Dr. Fujii died of cancer, but his life after the '
                 'bombing was one of wealth and the pursuit of pleasure. The '
                 'Reverend Mr. Tanimoto, after traveling to America several '
                 'times to raise money to aid the hibakusha, has retired '
                 'quietly, living out the rest of his life with vague memories '
                 'that day forty years ago.',

                 'rightwing fundamentalists murders the U.S. President and '
                 'members of Congress, disenfranchises women by impounding '
                 'their credit cards and denying them jobs and education, and '

                 'annihilating homosexuals, abortionists, and religious sects '
                 'other than their own, and resettling Jews, old women, and '
                 'nonwhite people in radioactive territory, known as the '
                 'Colonies. Because nuclear and biological warfare has '
                 'polluted vast areas, the population suffers a sharp decline '
                 'in viable births and a rise in birth defects. Consequently, '
                 'infertile and aged females, as well as homosexuals, are '
                 'dispatched as clean-up crews in the Colonies. Fertile women '
                 'involved in illicit liaisons or second marriages are '
                 'apprehended, indoctrinated, and parceled out to Commanders '
                 'of the secret police as Handmaids. These reduniformed '
                 'breeders live in seclusion and virtual slavery and are '
                 'deprived of their real names and labeled with a patronym of '
                 'the men who control their lives-as in "Ofcharles" and '
                 '"Ofwarren." The purpose of these polygynous relationships is '
                 'the perpetuation of the white race, which carries on warfare '
                 'in outlying areas in a struggle for supremacy. Offred, the '
                 'second wife of Luke and mother of a five-year-old daughter, '
                 'attempts to escape to Canada. She is apprehended and '
                 'separated from her family. Her mother, a vocal feminist, '
                 'disappears. Virtually alone and friendless, Offred is '
                 'selected as a potential breeder and indoctrinated at the '
                 'Rachel and Leah Re-Education Center. The '
                 'Handmaids-in-training share pared-down barracks — like '
                 'quarters in a gymnasium surrounded by fences topped by '
                 'barbed wire. Reunited with her feisty, rebellious college '
                 'pal Moira, Offred maintains spunk and individuality while '
                 'pretending to follow the direction of sadistic armed '
                 'matrons, particularly Aunt Lydia and Aunt Elizabeth. After '
                 'lights out, Moira, Offred, and other Handmaids offer '
                 'surreptitious support, survival tips, and bits of '
                 'information. Like conspirators, they observe the patrolling '
                 'Aunts and seize unguarded moments for normal behavior, '
                 'including gripe sessions, food stolen from the cafeteria, '
                 'and brief touches of hands between cots. Janine, a compliant '
                 'stooge, struggles so hard to adapt to the restrictive '
                 'Handmaid lifestyle that she retreats into a blank stare, '
                 'evidence of impending mental and emotional collapse. Because '
                 'Moira pretends to suffer an attack of appendicitis, she is '
                 'tortured by beatings with steel cables on her feet. '
                 'Ultimately, she overpowers Aunt Elizabeth, strips her, and '
                 "escapes in the Aunt's khaki uniform. Offred leaves the "
                 "Center and joins the robotic cadre of Gilead's Handmaids. "
                 'After one failed attempt to conceive, she passes into the '
                 'possession of a second official, Commander Fred, whose '
                 'previous Handmaid hanged herself from the bedroom light '
                 'fixture. Daily, Offred carries a basket to local markets to '
                 'obtain fresh food, then returns to a boring incarceration in '
                 'a cloistered room, relieved only by public prayer sessions, '
                 'birthings, monthly medical exams, and executions. Once a '
                 'month she mates with Commander Fred in a pseudo-religious '
                 'ritual requiring Bible reading, followed by copulation with '
                 'the Commander in the presence of his aging Wife, Serena Joy. '
                 'A spiteful, unhappy former gospel singer, Serena at first '
                 'disdains Offred, then grows so despondent at their mutual '
                 'barrenness that she arranges for Offred to conduct a secret '
                 'sexual liaison with Nick, the family chauffeur. Unknown to '
                 'Serena, the Commander has been summoning Offred to '
                 'late-night visits to his den for companionship, games of '
                 'Scrabble, kisses, and gifts of hand lotion, fashion '
                 'magazines, and information about the outside world. Offred '
                 'divulges a Latin phrase that her predecessor scratched on '
                 'the wall. The Commander translates it for her. On one of her '
                 'visits, the Commander presents her with borrowed finery — '
                 'makeup, high heels, a sequined and feathered costume, and an '
                 'evening cloak. Offred abandons her standard red outfit and, '
                 "dressed in whorish frippery, accompanies him to Jezebel's, "
                 'an illegal nightclub staffed by prostitutes and frequented '
                 'by Gilead officials and Japanese and Arab businessmen. '
                 'Offred locates Moira among the prostitutes and pumps her for '
                 'information. Moira relates her failed attempt to escape '
                 'Gilead and reports seeing a documentary film that contained '
                 "a glimpse of Offred's mother, now an Unwoman at a "
                 'radioactive Colony. On a late summer day, Serena confronts '
                 'Offred with the garish sequined garment and accuses her of '
                 'treachery. As Offred contemplates her alternatives — escape, '
                 "suicide, retreat to Nick's quarters, a plea for mercy from "
                 'the Commander — a black police van arrives. Nick enters her '
                 'room and hurries her into the custody of two operatives of '
                 'the Eyes, whom he indicates are double agents for Mayday, '
                 'the underground liberation group that Ofglen has hinted at. '
                 "Against the Commander's objections, the two agents charge "
                 'Offred with violating state secrets and hustle her into the '
                 'waiting van. Her narrative ends with her ambiguous departure '
                 "from the Commander's custody. On June 25, 2195, over two "
                 "centuries after the formation of Gilead's theocratic "
                 'dictatorship, an academic consortium listens to a keynote '
                 'speech delivered by Professor James Darcy Pieixoto, an '
                 "archivist who gives evidence of Offred's experiences as "
                 'narrated on thirty cassette tapes. The unnumbered segments '
                 'do not establish the existence of a real historical figure, '
                 'but shreds of data suggest that the voice on the tapes '
                 'belongs to a single speaker who identifies a real Commander, '
                 'possibly Frederick R. Waterford, who was eradicated during a '
                 "state purge of liberals. Pieixoto's surmise is that Offred "
                 'escaped Gilead on the Underground Femaleroad, connected with '
                 'a Quaker way station in Bangor, Maine, and concealed her '
                 'story on pre-recorded commercial tapes before departing to '
                 'either Canada or England. Pieixoto assumes that Offred lived '
                 'out her life in seclusion to spare her family from lethal '
                 'reprisals.',

 'summary_text': 'Chapter 1 opens as the wizard Gandalf visits the hobbit '
                 'Bilbo Baggins and invites him to join in an adventure. Bilbo '
                 'declines, reluctant to leave the safety and comfort of his '
                 'hobbit-hole. The next day, he is visited by dwarves who '
                 'believe Bilbo can be of use to them in their journey to the '
                 'Lonely Mountain to reclaim their ancestral treasure, now in '
                 'the possession of Smaug the dragon. Bilbo realizes that '
                 'Gandalf had represented him to the dwarves as a burglar. He '
                 'reluctantly agrees to go, but he changes his mind the next '
                 'morning. Gandalf urges him to join them, however, and they '
                 'depart — a band of fourteen. Chapters 2 through 10 depict '
                 'Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves traveling out of the '
                 'hobbit-lands toward the Lonely Mountain far to the east. As '
                 'the landscape becomes less hospitable and the group faces '
                 'hunger, bad weather, and attacks from hostile creatures, '
                 'Bilbo often thinks fondly of home and questions his decision '
                 'to come on this journey. In the Lone-lands, the travelers '
                 'encounter trolls who capture the dwarves and tie them up in '
                 'sacks, planning to roast and eat them later. They are '
                 'rescued by Gandalf and Bilbo, who produces a key he found '
                 "nearby. The key unlocks the trolls' secret cave, where the "
                 'travelers find gold and weapons, to which they help '
                 'themselves. They travel on to the valley of Rivendell at the '
                 'edge of the Wild, and stay at the home of Elrond, a '
                 'hospitable elf leader. Elrond translates the runes on the '
                 'swords that Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, king of the '
                 "dwarves, took from the trolls' cave; they are ancient swords "
                 'called Orcrist and Glamdring that come from dragon plunder '
                 "or the Goblin-wars. Elrond also translates Thorin's map, "
                 "which clarifies the importance of Durin's Day, the first day "
                 "of the dwarves' New Year.. After two weeks, Bilbo, Gandalf, "
                 'and the dwarves resume their journey. Approaching the Misty '
                 'Mountains, they take shelter from a storm in a cave that '
                 "turns out to be the Great Goblin's cavern. The Goblins "
                 'capture Bilbo and his companions and take their ponies. '
                 'Using Glamdring, Gandalf kills the Great Goblin and frees '
                 'Bilbo and the dwarves. The travelers try to find their way '
                 'out of the cave as the Goblins retreat, but Bilbo falls on '
                 'his way out and loses consciousness. When Bilbo regains '
                 'consciousness and tries to make his way out of the cave, he '
                 'finds a ring that he absentmindedly pockets. This incident, '
                 'in Chapter 5, marks a dramatic moment in his adventures, for '
                 'the ring confers powers of invisibility on whomever wears '
                 'it. Bilbo encounters old Gollum, a slimy, murderous creature '
                 'who kills and eats Goblins and others who stray into the '
                 'cave. They exchange riddles, and Gollum discovers that Bilbo '
                 "has the ring, which is Gollum's favorite possession. At the "
                 'same time, Bilbo puts on the ring and discovers its magical '
                 'power. Pursuing the invisible Bilbo, Gollum inadvertently '
                 'shows him the way out of the cave. Bilbo has the opportunity '
                 'to kill Gollum, but decides his invisibility is an unfair '
                 'advantage and, instead, leaps over his head through the '
                 'mouth of the cave. After he is outside, Bilbo plans to go '
                 'back and rescue his friends but finds they have escaped, '
                 'too. He tells his tale and gains their respect. Then they '
                 'all run away from the Mountains, fearful of the Goblins. '
                 'They are chased up into trees by Wargs, menacing wild '
                 'wolves. Gandalf chases the Wargs away, but the Wargs soon '
                 'return with Goblins and try to smoke Bilbo and the dwarves '
                 'out of the trees by setting fire to the forest. Bilbo and '
                 'the dwarves are rescued by eagles, who fly them to their '
                 'nest. After spending the night in safety, they resume their '
                 'travels east and Gandalf takes them to the house of Beorn, '
                 'the skin-changer, who outfits them for the next leg of their '
                 'journey, through the forest of Mirkwood. At the end of '
                 'Chapter 7, Gandalf leaves them at the edge of Mirkwood, '
                 'warning them not to stray from the path. Gandalf does not '
                 'reappear until the Battle of Five Armies near the end of the '
                 'book. Bilbo and the dwarves travel through the forest and '
                 'use a boat to cross an enchanted lake. They rescue Bombur, '
                 'one of the thirteen dwarves, from a fall into the lake. '
                 'Hungry, they approach a party of feasting elves, but to no '
                 'avail. Bilbo is captured by a spider, but fights his way '
                 'free with the sword he took from the trolls; he names it '
                 'Sting. Wearing the ring of invisibility, he frees the '
                 "dwarves who have been bound in spiders' webs and reveals to "
                 'them the secret of the ring. At the end of Chapter 8, Bilbo '
                 'and the dwarves find that Thorin has been captured by elves, '
                 'and in Chapter 9, all the dwarves are captured and thrown '
                 'into the dungeon under the palace of the Elvenking. Bilbo '
                 'escapes this fate because he is wearing the ring that makes '
                 "him invisible, and he wanders around the Elvenking's palace "
                 'until he has developed a plan to free the dwarves. He hides '
                 'them in empty wine barrels that are dropped through the '
                 'floor of the palace and float down the river to Esgaroth or '
                 'Lake-town. Bilbo and the dwarves spend some time in '
                 'Lake-town, a town of men, but then move on and disembark '
                 'near the Lonely Mountain. Chapter 11 depicts the encounter '
                 'with Smaug the dragon, the object of the journey. The '
                 "travelers can see the door to Smaug's lair in the side of "
                 "the Lonely Mountain, but they can't open it until Bilbo "
                 "suddenly understands the clues in Thorin's map. On Durin's "
                 "Day, using the key from Thorin's grandfather, Bilbo enters "
                 'the Lonely Mountain. He sees Smaug the dragon sitting on the '
                 'treasure hoard and, despite great fear, engages him in '
                 'conversation and emerges with a cup he has stolen from the '
                 'hoard. At this point, Bilbo becomes, in effect, the leader '
                 "of the group. He re-enters Smaug's lair and steals the "
                 'Arkenstone, the precious gem of the hoard. In a vengeful '
                 'rage, Smaug comes out of his lair and destroys the town of '
                 'Esgaroth. Bard, a Lake-town archer, kills Smaug. At this '
                 'point, in Chapter 14, various groups begin to converge on '
                 'the Lonely Mountain, because the treasure Smaug had guarded '
                 'is now up for grabs. Thorin refuses to ally with Bard or the '
                 'elves, and Bilbo gives Bard the Arkenstone to use in '
                 'bargaining with Thorin. Gandalf reappears. The Battle of '
                 'Five Armies ensues — dwarves, men, and elves fighting '
                 'against Goblins and Wargs. After the battle, Bilbo is taken '
                 'to see Thorin, who is dying. He is buried with Orcrist and '
                 'the Arkenstone; his inheritance, the hoard, is divided. '
                 'Bilbo leaves with Gandalf, Elvenking, and Beorn to go back '
                 'to the hobbit-lands. They stay with Beorn over Yule-tide and '
                 'return to Elrond in the spring. When Bilbo arrives home, he '
                 'finds that his house and its contents are being auctioned, '
                 'because he is presumed dead. He recovers most of his '
                 'possessions and leads an eccentric life, sometimes visited '
                 'by his travel companions.',

 'summary_text': 'Lawrence Selden, a bachelor lawyer, views the exquisitely '
                 'beautiful Lily Bart, a socialite who is expected to inherit '
                 'vast sums of money from her wealthy aunt, and who is further '
                 'anticipated to marry a man of vast wealth. Lily is '
                 'twenty-nine years old and worries that her physical beauty '
                 'is fading, which means that her chances for marrying an '
                 'eligible wealthy man are also becoming slimmer. An orphan, '
                 'Lily lives with her wealthy aunt, Mrs. Peniston, a miserly '
                 'woman who refuses to give her niece an allowance. Selden and '
                 "Lily retire to Selden's apartment for tea and discuss the "
                 'relative drawbacks to womanhood. Lily reveals to Selden that '
                 'her manner has served to put off a potential mother-in-law, '
                 "who has since sent Lily's prospective fiancé to India. Both "
                 'Selden and Lily agree that the social functions they attend '
                 "are boring affairs. Upon leaving Selden's apartment, Lily "
                 'meets Simon Rosedale, a bachelor whose wealth continues to '
                 'grow staggeringly, but whose presumptuous demeanor Lily '
                 'finds repulsive. Lily attends a weekend party at the country '
                 'home of Judy and Gus Trenor, where she attempts to cement an '
                 'engagement to the wealthy — and boring — young bachelor '
                 'Percy Gryce. Lily turns her attentions to Selden, but finds '
                 'that she has competition from Bertha Dorset, a married guest '
                 'who has designs on Selden. Lily and Selden have a '
                 'conversation in which it is decided that he is not wealthy '
                 'enough to marry Lily. In the meantime, a bitter Bertha '
                 "sabotages Lily's chances with Gryce by shocking him with the "
                 'knowledge that Lily plays cards for money. On a ride to '
                 'town, Trenor tells Lily that he will invest money for her '
                 'with no financial risk. Lily is approached by a cleaning '
                 'woman who has recently been fired from the building where '
                 'Selden lives. Believing that Lily is the woman responsible '
                 'for writing love letters to Selden, the woman wishes to sell '
                 'the letters to her. Lily purchases the letters and discovers '
                 'that they have been written by Bertha. In the meantime, '
                 "Trenor's investments on Lily's behalf are paying off, and "
                 'Rosedale continues trying to court Lily. Grace Stepney, '
                 "Lily's cousin, is embittered by Lily's removal of Grace from "
                 'a dinner party attendance list, and proceeds to tell Mrs. '
                 'Peniston that Lily has been gambling and spending '
                 'extravagantly. She also tells Mrs. Peniston that there are '
                 'rumors that Lily is receiving money from Trenor, in effect '
                 'making her a "kept woman." Judy has also heard of the '
                 'financial arrangement between her husband and Lily, and '
                 'disassociates herself from Lily. Lily attends a social '
                 'function at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Wellington Bry, two '
                 'nouveau riche socialites. She poses in a tableau vivant, and '
                 'her beauty is made apparent to all who attend. Selden '
                 'professes his love for Lily, but she rebuffs him. The '
                 'following evening, Lily meets with Trenor. Trenor feels that '
                 'Lily owes him her physical affections for his financial '
                 'assistance. Feeling violated, she leaves, and spends the '
                 "night with Selden's cousin, the virtuous and physically "
                 'undistinguished Gerty Farish, a kindly and charitable woman '
                 'who has recently discovered that she is in love with Selden. '
                 'The following morning, Lily determines that she will repay '
                 'Trenor. She rebuffs another proposal from Rosedale and waits '
                 'for the arrival of Selden. She discovers that Selden has '
                 'gone to Europe and receives an invitation to join the '
                 'Dorsets on a Mediterranean cruise. During the cruise, Lily '
                 'is a success with the European crowd, much to the dismay of '
                 'Bertha. Bertha wishes to employ Lily as a means to distract '
                 'her husband, George Dorset, while she engages in a '
                 'flirtation with Ned Silverton. When Silverton and Bertha '
                 "miss a train back to where the Dorsets' yacht is docked, "
                 'Dorset and Lily return without them. Bertha returns to the '
                 "yacht at seven o'clock the following morning. In order to "
                 'excuse her absence, she insinuates that Lily and Dorset '
                 'parted without her and Silverton in order to indulge in '
                 'their own flirtation. Lily is told she must not return to '
                 "the yacht. The European stories regarding Lily's activities "
                 'reach America and Mrs. Peniston, who dies leaving only '
                 '$10,000 to Lily, a legacy that will take some time before '
                 'being fulfilled. Rejected by her friends for the perceived '
                 'indiscretion with Dorset, Lily finds work with the Gormers. '
                 'Bertha, however, befriends Mattie Gormer, and Lily is soon '
                 'out of work. She then finds work as a secretary to Mrs. '
                 "Norma Hatch, a divorcée and recent addition to New York's "
                 'wealthy elite. Norma has designs to marry Freddy Van '
                 "Osburgh, a member of Lily's previous social group. Fearing "
                 'charges of impropriety, Lily quits her job. She works, '
                 'ineptly, at a millinery shop, and is laid off. Her mounting '
                 'bills and increasing sleeplessness cause her to rely on '
                 'chloral (chlorinated ethyl alcohol) in order to rest and '
                 'forget her financial worries. Lily resumes her contact with '
                 "Rosedale, who offers to marry her if she uses Bertha's "
                 'letters to Selden to even the score with Bertha. After some '
                 'consideration, Lily begins to take the letters to Bertha, '
                 'but she has an attack of conscience and visits Selden '
                 'instead. She deposits the letters into the flames of a fire '
                 'in his apartment. Neither Selden nor Lily can profess their '
                 'love, and she leaves his apartment. The following morning, '
                 'Selden realizes that he still loves Lily. He goes to her '
                 'boardinghouse to tell her, but is greeted by Gerty, who '
                 'tells her cousin that Lily has overdosed on chloral the '
                 'night before and is now dead.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The House of the Seven Gables once a "show place" in a small '
                 'New England town, now presents little evidence of its former '
                 'grandeur. Wind, sun, storm, and neglect left its sides, '
                 'shingles, and chimney crumbling. Its gray look is mottled '
                 'here and there with moss. The lattice fence surrounding it '
                 'is in ruin. The lawn in front, and what must have been a '
                 'spacious garden at the rear, long since have missed the care '
                 "of the cultivator's hand. There in front, to the right of "
                 'the imposing entrance, is a small door adjacent to a window '
                 'of what obviously was once a shop. The house reflects the '
                 'unfortunate circumstances under which it was built some 160 '
                 'years before by Colonel Pyncheon, one of the early Puritan '
                 'settlers on the bleak New England coast. The site upon which '
                 'the house stood originally belonged to a man of poor '
                 'circumstances named Matthew Maule. In the center of the site '
                 'was a wonderful spring of sweet flowing water. Colonel '
                 'Pyncheon would build his mansion on no other site. To obtain '
                 "it he was instrumental in Matthew Maule's being charged with "
                 'witchcraft, for which Maule was hanged. On the gallows, '
                 'Maule cried out that the Pyncheons would forever be cursed. '
                 'No sooner had the cruel and grasping Colonel Pyncheon '
                 'completed his beautiful and imposing House of the Seven '
                 'Gables than he died of a strange death on the very day the '
                 'townspeople had been invited to its opening. The curse of '
                 'Matthew Maule, some said, persists in plaguing the old house '
                 'and its inhabitants. Now over a century and a half later, '
                 'the sole family member inhabiting the old place is Hepzibah '
                 'Pyncheon, an aging old maid. There is also a Mr. Holgrave, a '
                 'daguerreotypist and artist, who rents upstairs apartments. '
                 'One day a pretty young girl arrives at the old house; she is '
                 "Phoebe Pyncheon. Hepzibah is impressed with her niece's "
                 'cheerful, wholesome, and helpful disposition and permits her '
                 'to stay for a week or two. Somehow, despite the cavernous '
                 'darkness of the old mansion, Phoebe manages to lighten the '
                 "gloom. Before Phoebe's arrival, Hepzibah had set aside what "
                 'pride was left to the family and opened up a "one cent" '
                 "shop. At about this time, Hepzibah's brother Clifford "
                 'arrives to make his home there. This poor, aging man seems '
                 "to have the intellect of a child. Hepzibah's loving effort "
                 "to restore her brother's health is futile. Phoebe then takes "
                 "over, and Clifford seems to respond to the young girl's "
                 'care. The old mansion reverts to its gloom, however, when '
                 'Phoebe ends her visit and returns to her farm home. At about '
                 'this time, Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, a wealthy man of the town '
                 'who lives in a palatial country place, visits Hepzibah and '
                 'demands to see Clifford. Hepzibah steadfastly refuses, but '
                 'one day the Judge says that he must see Clifford or '
                 'institute proceedings to have him committed to an insane '
                 'asylum. Clifford, says the Judge, knows of the whereabouts '
                 'of documents which will give the Judge possession of a vast '
                 'tract of land to the east in Maine. Hepzibah finally relents '
                 'and ushers the Judge into the parlor where he sits down, '
                 'with watch in hand, to impatiently await the arrival of '
                 'Clifford from his upstairs chamber. Hepzibah finds '
                 "Clifford's chamber empty and frantically races downstairs to "
                 'beg the Judge to help find him. But there, in the parlor, '
                 'stands Clifford in a wild state of excitement pointing at '
                 "the Judge's dead figure sitting in the chair. Hepzibah and "
                 'Clifford flee to the railroad station and board a train just '
                 'ready to leave. Impulsively, Clifford and Hepzibah later '
                 'leave the train at a deserted railway station many miles '
                 'from the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe returns to the '
                 'old mansion, now strangely silent, and locked shut. Holgrave '
                 "admits her and informs her of the Judge's strange death. He "
                 'begs Phoebe to give him a moment more before she calls the '
                 'sheriff. He recalls the many pleasant hours they spent in '
                 'the garden on her first visit, when he confessed his love '
                 'for her. She confesses she is in love with him. At that '
                 'moment, Clifford and Hepzibah return. Subsequently the '
                 "Judge's wealth is inherited by Phoebe, Clifford, and "
                 "Hepzibah. Examination of the Judge's past suggests that he "
                 "knew the circumstances of his rich uncle's death, and that "
                 "he was responsible for Clifford's being imprisoned for the "
                 "uncle's murder. Phoebe and Holgrave, who now confesses he "
                 'was the last descendant of Matthew Maule, are pledged to be '
                 'wed. With some regret, but with greater joy, they pack their '
                 "belongings and go to the Judge's country place. The old "
                 'house is left to its sad and tragic memories.',

 'summary_text': 'Esperanza Cordero and her parents, sister, and brothers move '
                 'into a house on Mango Street, after having lived in numerous '
                 'other locations in Chicago, only some of which Esperanza '
                 "remembers. At least this latest house is the Corderos' own, "
                 'but in other respects, it is not the house Esperanza would '
                 'have hoped for. Esperanza meets some of her neighbors — '
                 'Cathy (whose family is about to move out because the '
                 'neighborhood is going downhill), Lucy and Rachel (two '
                 'sisters who live across the street), a boy named Tito, '
                 'another named Meme Ortiz (whose family has moved into '
                 "Cathy's house), yet another boy named Louie, Louie's cousin "
                 "Marin, and Louie's other cousin. Esperanza gets to know "
                 'Marin a little better and learns that she is hoping to marry '
                 'a boy in Puerto Rico but that she is still interested in '
                 "other boys. Esperanza reflects that people who don't live in "
                 'the neighborhood are afraid to come into it, whereas those '
                 'who live there feel quite safe but are afraid to go into '
                 'other neighborhoods. She tells about the Vargas kids, whose '
                 "father left and whose mother can't control them, and about "
                 'Alicia, who is going to the university and at the same time '
                 'keeping house for her father. Esperanza and her friends hang '
                 'out, looking at clouds, talking idly. A woman gives '
                 'Esperanza, Lucy, and Rachel three pairs of high-heeled '
                 'shoes, which they wear around the neighborhood. Esperanza '
                 'pleads with her mother to let her take her lunch to school, '
                 "but when she is allowed to do so, she doesn't enjoy it. She "
                 'goes to a baptismal party for a baby cousin and dances with '
                 'her uncle. She, Nenny, Lucy, and Rachel talk about getting '
                 'hips, and Esperanza gets her first job, in a '
                 'photo-developing store. Her grandfather dies in Mexico, her '
                 'Aunt Lupe dies in Chicago, and Esperanza goes to a '
                 'fortune-teller who informs her that she will have a home in '
                 'the heart. At a dance, her friend Marin meets a man who is '
                 'later injured in a hit-and-run accident; Marin waits in the '
                 'hospital while he dies. Esperanza describes two neighborhood '
                 "adults whom she finds interesting: Edna's daughter Ruthie "
                 'and a jukebox repairman named Earl. She tells about a boy — '
                 'Sire — who sometimes stares at her, and talks about her '
                 'relationship to four trees growing from the sidewalk in '
                 'front of her house. Then Esperanza describes two married '
                 'women she knows — Mamacita , who is very fat, very homesick, '
                 'and cannot speak English, and Rafaela, who is young and '
                 'beautiful, and whose husband locks her in their apartment '
                 'while he goes out to play dominoes with his friends. Sally, '
                 "who is about Esperanza's age, makes herself attractive to "
                 'boys and young men but is mistreated by her father, who is '
                 'afraid she will run away with some boy or young man. And '
                 'Minerva (who also writes poems), not much older than '
                 'Esperanza, has two little children and a husband who leaves '
                 'her sometimes but then comes back and beats her. When she '
                 'has a house, Esperanza says, it will be a big, fine one, and '
                 'she will let "bums" stay upstairs in the attic. She has '
                 'decided to be independent, like a man. Her mother tells her '
                 'that she herself quit school because she was ashamed of her '
                 "clothes. Sally's father beats her so badly that her mother "
                 "allows her to come and stay with Esperanza's family, but he "
                 'comes to get her, begs her to come home with him, and then '
                 'beats her worse. Esperanza and Sally go to play in an '
                 'overgrown and deserted garden, but Sally would rather hang '
                 'out with the boys, and Esperanza embarrasses herself by '
                 "trying to protect Sally, who doesn't want to be protected. "
                 'The two girls go to a carnival, and Sally leaves with a boy; '
                 'Esperanza, waiting for her to return, is overpowered by '
                 'several strangers and sexually assaulted by one of them. Now '
                 'Sally has married a young man she met at a school function, '
                 "and he makes her stay in their house and won't let her "
                 "friends visit. Lucy and Rachel's youngest sister, an infant, "
                 "dies; at their house, Esperanza meets her friends' three "
                 'aunts (or, most likely, great aunts), who draw her aside and '
                 'tell her she is special. When she leaves Mango Street, they '
                 "say, she must not neglect to come back for those who can't "
                 'leave. Her friend Alicia echoes this advice when they talk '
                 "on Edna's steps. And, at last, Esperanza says that she will "
                 'have a house of her own, she will someday leave Mango Street '
                 '— and, sometimes, writing about it helps her make it leave '
                 'her — but she will come back for the others. Twenty-two '
                 'short pieces, all self-contained, variously set in Texas, '
                 'Chicago, and Mexico, mostly from the 1960s to the late 1980s '
                 '(with one exception, "Eyes of Zapata," which takes place in '
                 'the early years of the twentieth century) comprise "Woman '
                 'Hollering Creek" and Other Stories. Characters narrate all '
                 'but three or four of the stories, and these voices vary from '
                 'that of a five-or- six-year-old girl to that of an elderly '
                 'man. Several of the pieces are only a page or two long; the '
                 'two longest, "Eyes of Zapata" and " Bien Pretty," are each '
                 'about 29 pages. Most of the stories are non-traditional in '
                 'structure, following a non-linear shape in which the '
                 'narrator "circles" around her or his topic, examining it '
                 'from various angles and in various times. Those that do '
                 'follow a conventionally linear pattern tend to flatten that '
                 'pattern ironically. All of the pieces are serious; many are '
                 'very funny, too.',

{'author': 'Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee',
 'book_title': 'Inherit the Wind',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'As Inherit the Wind opens, Bert Cates, having been arrested '
                 'for teaching evolution to his sophomore science class, is in '
                 'jail. Rachel Brown, his girlfriend and the daughter of '
                 'Reverend Brown (the spiritual leader of Hillsboro) visits '
                 'him. Rachel is confused and torn between the opposing '
                 'beliefs held by Cates (academic freedom) and her father '
                 '(fundamentalism) and her love for both of them. Desperately '
                 'wanting to avoid the mounting controversy over his case, she '
                 'pleads with Cates to admit he was wrong to teach evolution, '
                 'and she is disappointed that Cates refuses. Cates is nervous '
                 'and frightened because he has learned that Matthew Harrison '
                 'Brady, three-time presidential candidate, fundamentalist, '
                 'and leader of the crusade against evolution, has volunteered '
                 'to be the prosecuting attorney. He reveals to the bailiff, '
                 'Mr. Meeker, that he has sent a letter to the Baltimore '
                 'Herald asking for an attorney to defend him. To celebrate '
                 "Brady's arrival, the townspeople of Hillsboro carry posters, "
                 'hang banners, provide a picnic lunch "fitt\'n fer a king," '
                 'and parade through the town singing "Gimme that old-time '
                 'religion." Brady basks in the adoration of his followers and '
                 'vows to defend the people of Hillsboro against "Evil-ution." '
                 'E.K. Hornbeck, cynical columnist for the Baltimore Herald , '
                 'also arrives in Hillsboro. He openly mocks Brady and is '
                 'contemptuous of the bigotry and ignorance he observes in '
                 "Hillsboro. He informs Brady's followers that Henry Drummond, "
                 'an attorney famous for successfully defending underdogs, has '
                 'been sent by the Baltimore Herald to defend Cates. Drummond '
                 'arrives in Hillsboro later that evening. Upon his arrival, '
                 'the only attention he receives is from Melinda, a young girl '
                 "who screams that he's the devil. When the trial begins, the "
                 'courtroom is full. Both Brady and Drummond are self-assured: '
                 'Brady, because he has the support of the spectators and is '
                 'confident that his fundamentalist views are right and will, '
                 'therefore, prevail; Drummond, because he seeks the truth. '
                 'After the first day in court, which involves selecting the '
                 'jury, Reverend Brown holds a prayer meeting, at which he '
                 'delivers a fire-and-brimstone sermon. Becoming overzealous, '
                 'he prays that Cates be destroyed. When his daughter, Rachel, '
                 'tries to stop him, he condemns her as well. Uncomfortable '
                 'with the tenor of the prayer and afraid that Reverend '
                 "Brown's actions may hinder the support the townspeople have "
                 "in him, Brady steps forward and curtails Reverend Brown's "
                 'sermon by reciting the wisdom of Solomon. The following day, '
                 "the trial proceeds and witnesses are called. Cates' students "
                 'testify, and Rachel, whom Brady tricked into revealing '
                 "confidential conversations she'd had with Cates, also "
                 "testifies. The judge excludes Drummond's scientific "
                 'witnesses claiming that evolution itself is not on trial. '
                 'Determined to challenge the Butler Law, Drummond shrewdly '
                 'switches his tactics and calls Brady to testify as an expert '
                 'on the Bible. Brady arrogantly and ignorantly agrees to take '
                 "the stand. Drummond's cross-examination of Brady, in which "
                 "he exposes that Brady doesn't interpret the Bible literally "
                 "and destroys Brady's credibility by questioning his status "
                 'as a self-anointed prophet, changes the course of the trial. '
                 'The jury finds Cates guilty, and he is fined $100. Brady '
                 'protests the minimal punishment. Although he won the case, '
                 'his victory is a hollow one. The real triumph belongs to '
                 'Drummond and Cates, who win a moral victory for freedom of '
                 'thought. Trying to stem the tide of attention and support '
                 'that has rapidly drifted away from him, Brady insists on '
                 'giving his closing speech, despite the fact that court had '
                 'been adjourned and carnival atmosphere has intruded. Only a '
                 'few of the faithful followers seem prepared to listen; the '
                 'others who remain listen only grudgingly. Brady begins his '
                 "speech, but he is unable to hold the crowd's attention. The "
                 'final insult occurs when the radio announcer interrupts '
                 'Brady to return the listeners to their regularly scheduled '
                 'broadcast. Brady collapses, is removed from the courtroom, '
                 'and soon after dies. Rachel enters the courtroom, carrying a '
                 'suitcase. She apologizes to Cates for her lack of '
                 'understanding and to Drummond for possibly offending him. '
                 "She reveals that she has read Darwin's On Origin of Species, "
                 "and, although she doesn't like the premise of evolutionary "
                 'theory, she now understands how important having the freedom '
                 'to think is. She chooses to support Cates and leave her '
                 'father. Hornbeck continues to mock Brady after learning of '
                 'his death, and Drummond defends Brady, angrily pointing out '
                 'that "Brady had the same right as Cates: the right to be '
                 'wrong!" Then Drummond leaves the courtroom with a Bible and '
                 "a copy of Darwin's On the Origin of Species .",

{'author': 'Ralph Ellison',
 'book_title': 'Invisible Man',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Invisible Man is the story of a young, college-educated '
                 'black man struggling to survive and succeed in a racially '
                 'divided society that refuses to see him as a human being. '
                 'Told in the form of a first-person narrative, Invisible Man '
                 "traces the nameless narrator's physical and psychological "
                 'journey from blind ignorance to enlightened awareness — or, '
                 'according to the author, "from Purpose to Passion to '
                 'Perception" — through a series of flashbacks in the forms of '
                 'dreams and memories. Set in the U.S. during the pre-Civil '
                 'Rights era when segregation laws barred black Americans from '
                 'enjoying the same basic human rights as their white '
                 'counterparts, the novel opens in the South (Greenwood, South '
                 'Carolina), although the majority of the action takes place '
                 'in the North (Harlem, New York). In the Prologue, the '
                 'narrator — speaking to us from his underground hideout in '
                 'the basement (coal cellar) of a whites-only apartment '
                 'building — reminisces about his life as an invisible man. '
                 'Now in his 40s, he recalls a time when he was a naïve young '
                 'man, eager to become a renowned educator and orator. The '
                 'narrator begins his story by recalling his high school '
                 'graduation speech, which attracted the attention of the '
                 'white school superintendent who invites him to give the same '
                 "speech at a local hotel to the town's leading white "
                 'citizens. But when he arrives at the hotel, the narrator is '
                 'forced to participate in a brutal blindfolded boxing match '
                 '(the "battle royal") with nine of his classmates, an event, '
                 "which, he discovers, is part of the evening's entertainment "
                 'for the "smoker" (a kind of stag party). The entertainment '
                 'also includes a sensuous dance by a naked blonde woman, and '
                 'the boys are forced to watch. The boxing match is followed '
                 'by a humiliating event: The boys must scramble for what '
                 'appear to be gold coins on an electrified rug (but, which '
                 'turn out to be only worthless brass tokens). Then the '
                 'narrator — now bruised and bleeding — is finally allowed to '
                 'give his speech in front of the drunken white men who '
                 'largely ignore him until he accidentally uses the phrase '
                 '"social equality" instead of "social responsibility" to '
                 'describe the role of blacks in America. At the end of his '
                 'speech — despite his degrading and humiliating ordeal — the '
                 'narrator proudly accepts his prize: a calfskin briefcase '
                 'containing a scholarship to the state college for Negroes. '
                 "That night, the narrator's dead grandfather — a former slave "
                 '— appears in a dream, ordering him to open the briefcase and '
                 'look inside. Instead of the scholarship, the briefcase '
                 'contains a note that reads, "Keep This Nigger Boy Running." '
                 'The dream sets the stage. For the next 20 years of his life, '
                 'the narrator stumbles blindly through life, never stopping '
                 'to question why he is always kept running by people — both '
                 'black and white — who profess to guide and direct him, but '
                 'who ultimately exploit him and betray his trust. Focusing on '
                 'the events of one fateful day, the narrator then recalls his '
                 'college days. Assigned to chauffeur Mr. Norton, a prominent '
                 'white visiting trustee, around the campus, the narrator '
                 "follows Mr. Norton's orders and takes him to visit two sites "
                 'in the nearby black neighborhood — the cabin of Jim '
                 'Trueblood, a local sharecropper, and the Golden Day, a '
                 'disreputable bar/half-way house for shell-shocked World War '
                 'I veterans. The narrator, however, is expelled from his '
                 'beloved college for taking Mr. Norton to these places and '
                 'sent to New York, armed with seven letters from his dean '
                 '(Dr. Bledsoe). The letters, he believed, are letters of '
                 'recommendation, but are in reality letters confirming his '
                 'expulsion. Arriving in New York City, the narrator is amazed '
                 'by what he perceives to be unlimited freedom for blacks. He '
                 'is especially intrigued by a black West Indian man (later '
                 'identified as Ras the Exhorter) whom he first encounters '
                 'addressing a group of men and women on the streets of '
                 'Harlem, urging them to work together to unite their black '
                 "community. But the narrator's excitement soon turns to "
                 'disillusionment as he discovers that the North presents the '
                 'same barriers to black achievement as the South. Realizing '
                 'that he cannot return to college, the narrator accepts a job '
                 'at a paint factory famous for its optic white paint, unaware '
                 'that he is one of several blacks hired to replace white '
                 'workers out on strike. Nearly killed in a factory explosion, '
                 'the narrator subsequently undergoes a grueling ordeal at the '
                 'paint factory hospital, where he finds himself the object of '
                 "a strange experiment by the hospital's white doctors. "
                 'Following his release from the hospital, the narrator finds '
                 'refuge in the home of Mary Rambo, a kind and generous black '
                 'woman, who feeds him and nurses him back to health. Although '
                 'grateful to Mary, whom he acknowledges as his only friend, '
                 'the narrator — anxious to earn a living and do something '
                 'with his life — eventually leaves Mary to join the '
                 'Brotherhood, a political organization that professes to be '
                 'dedicated to achieving equality for all people. Under the '
                 'guidance of the Brotherhood and its leader, Brother Jack, '
                 'the narrator becomes an accomplished speaker and leader of '
                 'the Harlem District. He also has an abortive liaison with '
                 'Sybil, a sexually frustrated white woman who sees him as the '
                 'embodiment of the stereotypical black man endowed with '
                 'extraordinary sexual prowess. But after the tragic death of '
                 'his friend Tod Clifton, a charismatic young black "Brother" '
                 'who is shot by a white policeman, the narrator becomes '
                 'disillusioned with the disparity between what the '
                 'organization preaches and what its leaders practice. As a '
                 'result, he decides to leave the Brotherhood, headquartered '
                 'in an affluent section of Manhattan, and returns to Harlem '
                 'where he is confronted by Ras the Exhorter (now Ras the '
                 'Destroyer) who accuses him of betraying the black community. '
                 'To escape the wrath of Ras and his men, the narrator '
                 'disguises himself by donning a hat and dark glasses. In '
                 'disguise, he is repeatedly mistaken for someone named '
                 'Rinehart, a con man who uses his invisibility to his own '
                 'advantage. The narrator discovers that the Harlem community '
                 'has erupted in violence. Eager to demonstrate that he is no '
                 'longer part of the Brotherhood, the narrator allows himself '
                 'to be drawn into the violence and chaos of the Harlem riot '
                 'and participates in the burning of a Harlem tenement. Later, '
                 'as he flees the scene of the burning building and tries to '
                 "find his way back to Mary's, two white men with baseball "
                 'bats pursue him. To escape his assailants, he leaps into a '
                 'manhole, which lands him in his underground hideout. For the '
                 'next several days the sick and delusional narrator suffers '
                 'horrific nightmares in which he is captured and castrated by '
                 'a group of men led by Brother Jack. Finally able to let go '
                 'of his painful past — symbolized by the various items in his '
                 'briefcase — the narrator discovers that writing down his '
                 'experiences enables him to release his hatred and rediscover '
                 'his love of life.',

                 'Richard the Lion-Hearted (1157-1199), now King of England, '
                 'on returning from the Crusades, was made prisoner of the '
                 "Duke of Austria, abetted by the machinations of Richard's "
                 'brother, Prince John. Prince John hoped, by the help of his '
                 'Norman confederates, to seize the throne. Wilfred of '
                 'Ivanhoe, son of Cedric, had been disinherited by his father '
                 'for two reasons: because of his allegiance to Richard, the '
                 'exiled King of England, and because of his romantic interest '
                 'in Rowena, ward of Cedric, whom Cedric intended as bride to '
                 'Athelstane, a descendant of Saxon royalty. In the guise of '
                 'the Disinherited Knight, Ivanhoe wins the tournament at '
                 'Ashby-de-la-Zouche with the aid of the Black Knight and '
                 'crowns Rowena his Queen of Beauty and Love. He suffers '
                 'severe wounds in the contest and is ministered to by '
                 'Rebecca, daughter of the Jewish moneylender, Isaac of York. '
                 'On the way home from the tournament the Saxon party, '
                 'together with the Jews and the wounded Ivanhoe, are captured '

                 'Black Knight, Locksley and his band, Cedric, and others '
                 'attack the castle and, with the help of Ulrica, an old Saxon '

 'summary_text': 'After spending several years in a Swiss mental institution, '
                 'where he was treated for epilepsy, Prince Lyov Myshkin '
                 'returns penniless to Petersburg and visits distant relatives '
                 '— the Epanchins. He proves himself a master of calligraphy '
                 'and is hired by General Epanchin, who finds that he is '
                 'strangely fond of the prince. Myshkin is then introduced to '
                 "the general's wife and daughters and, afterward, he goes "
                 "home with Ganya Ivolgin, the general's secretary; Myshkin "
                 "will board with the Ivolgins. At Ganya's, Myshkin meets the "
                 'Ivolgin family and quickly finds himself involved in a '
                 'family quarrel when he mentions that Ganya has received a '
                 "portrait of Nastasya Filippovna. Ganya's family is fearful "
                 'that Ganya will marry Nastasya — a beautiful, but well-known '
                 '"kept" woman. In the midst of the quarreling, Nastasya '
                 'appears. She is as bewitchingly beautiful as Rogozhin (a '
                 'fellow Myshkin met on the morning train) said she was; '
                 "Myshkin immediately understands Rogozhin's sworn devotion to "
                 'her. And Nastasya is as striking as the portrait which Ganya '
                 "showed earlier in General Epanchin's office. Nastasya is "
                 'polite to the Ivolgins only momentarily. She turns surly and '
                 "is sarcastic to Ganya's mother and sister and then turns on "
                 'Myshkin, asking him why he finds her attractive. She is '
                 "fascinated by the prince's confession concerning his meeting "
                 'with Rogozhin on the train but she is even more fascinated '
                 'when Rogozhin himself suddenly storms into the Ivolgin '
                 'house. Rogozhin is shocked to discover Nastasya, but he is '
                 'not deterred from his purpose in coming. He offers to buy '
                 'Nastasya from Ganya; then, he offers to pay a final bid of '
                 '100,000 rubles to Nastasya — in exchange for herself. The '
                 'company is thrown into an uproar. Varya condemns Nastasya, '
                 'and Ganya, lashing out to slap his sister, strikes Myshkin, '
                 'who has stepped in front of the girl. This chivalry quiets '
                 'the party and, after Rogozhin and Nastasya leave, Myshkin is '
                 'taken to his room. Later that night, Myshkin goes to '
                 "Nastasya Filippovna's birthday party. He is uninvited but is "
                 'welcomed by Nastasya. After champagne is served and games '
                 'are played, Nastasya announces that, at last, she will '
                 'reveal whether or not she has decided to marry Ganya '
                 'Ivolgin. She turns to Myshkin and says that his decision '
                 'will be her fate. Myshkin whispers that she must not marry '
                 'Ganya and, amidst loud protestations, Rogozhin and his noisy '
                 'band of followers are ushered in. Rogozhin has brought the '
                 '100,000 rubles he promised to pay Nastasya, but Nastasya '
                 'changes her mind; she will begin her new life penniless. '
                 'Under those conditions, no one would have her. Myshkin '
                 'objects; he would marry her and he reveals that he is heir '
                 'to a fortune of a million and a half rubles. Nastasya '
                 "instantly agrees to Myshkin's proposal, then impulsively "
                 'refuses and flees into the night with Rogozhin. Myshkin '
                 'follows the couple, and after the three live for a time in '
                 'Moscow (where Nastasya decides to marry Rogozhin, then '
                 'refuses, and comes to Myshkin for comfort), Myshkin returns '
                 'to Petersburg. He visits Lebedyev (a fellow he met on the '
                 'train with Rogozhin) and also visits Rogozhin. He tries to '
                 'convince Rogozhin that the two men are not rivals for '
                 'Nastasya and, seemingly, Rogozhin understands and swears to '
                 "be Myshkin's spiritual brother. But after Myshkin leaves "
                 'Rogozhin, he wanders absently and finds himself at Nastasya '
                 "Filippovna's house. The girl is not at home but Myshkin "
                 'senses that Rogozhin has followed him. He is correct; '
                 'Rogozhin has followed Myshkin to see if he would go to '
                 'Nastasya as the victorious suitor. Rogozhin then follows '
                 'Myshkin back to his hotel and attempts to murder the prince '
                 'but Myshkin suffers an epileptic attack when he realizes '
                 'that it is Rogozhin who is hiding in the dark with a raised '
                 "knife. The attack saves the prince's life. Recuperating at "
                 "Lebedyev's villa in Pavlovsk Myshkin is visited by the "
                 'Epanchins and, during their visit, several young men demand '
                 'to see the prince. Before the Epanchins, the young men '
                 'demand money from Myshkin; he is not the true son of '
                 'Pavlishtchev, while Burdovsky (one of the intruders) is, '
                 'although illegitimate, and they demand that Myshkin give '
                 'Burdovsky his rightful inheritance. Myshkin exposes the '
                 "young men as frauds; he has known of Burdovsky's claim and "
                 'has had Ganya verifying the facts of the case. Myshkin says '
                 'that he will not give the men conscience money, but, he '
                 'says, because Pavlishtchev did take an interest in Burdovsky '
                 '(the boy is the nephew of a woman Pavlishtchev was once in '
                 'love with), he offers to give Burdovsky 10,000 rubles — '
                 "approximately what Pavlishtchev spent on Myshkin's education "
                 'and medical bills. Madame Epanchin is aghast at such '
                 'unnecessary extravagance and, after Ippolit, one of the '
                 'young men, damns the company, she gathers up her family and '
                 'leaves. As they leave, a carriage drives up and a voice '
                 'shouts to Radomsky, an admirer of Aglaia Epanchin, about '
                 'some lOUs; Myshkin recognizes the voice as Nastasya '
                 "Filippovna's. Soon afterward, Myshkin accompanies the "
                 'Epanchins and friends to the park, and when Nastasya enters, '
                 'and is insulted, Myshkin rushes to her aid and defends her '
                 'from the wrath of an army officer. Aglaia is sure that '
                 'Myshkin will be forced to duel with the officer, but Myshkin '
                 'is unconcerned. He celebrates his birthday and, afterward, '
                 'the company listens to Ippolit as he reads a long testament '
                 'describing his thoughts on death and life, then raises a '
                 'pocket pistol to his temple and fires. There is no cap in '
                 'the gun and the company roars in laughter. Ippolit swears '
                 'that he meant to kill himself, then collapses. Unable to '
                 'sleep, Myshkin goes walking in the park, falls asleep on a '
                 'bench, and is awakened by Aglaia Epanchin. She tells Myshkin '
                 'that she can no longer bear her family and that she wants to '
                 'elope with Myshkin to Europe. Myshkin says that the idea is '
                 'preposterous and, suddenly, Madame Epanchin stands before '
                 'them demanding an explanation. After Myshkin confesses that '
                 'he would like to marry Aglaia, and Aglaia consents, a '
                 'betrothal party is planned: Myshkin must be introduced to '
                 'Petersburg society. The party is a disaster. Myshkin '
                 'launches into one of his long-winded, emotional tirades — '
                 'this time against the Catholic church — breaks an expensive '
                 'vase, and finally collapses in an epileptic seizure. When '
                 'Myshkin recovers, Aglaia asks him to go with her to Nastasya '
                 "Filippovna's house and Myshkin agrees. Rogozhin is also "
                 'there and he and Myshkin witness a violent argument between '
                 'the two women. Nastasya has hoped to arrange a marriage '
                 'between Aglaia and Myshkin, but Aglaia accuses Nastasya of '
                 'toying with the prince and damns her for her past and for '
                 'her corrupting Myshkin. To retaliate, Nastasya reminds '
                 'Aglaia that Myshkin has promised to marry her and that she '
                 'can force him to do so. Myshkin acquiesces and tries to '
                 'follow Aglaia as she runs from the house, but turns to aid '
                 'Nastasya when he sees that she has fainted. The wedding is '
                 'arranged and Myshkin waits at the church for Nastasya. '
                 'Nastasya, however, has changed her mind again. She cannot '
                 'bring herself to marry the prince; he is too good and she '
                 'too tarnished. She asks Rogozhin to take her away. Myshkin '
                 'is told that the two have fled and he goes into Petersburg '
                 'and finally finds Rogozhin waiting for him. Rogozhin takes '
                 "the prince home with him and shows him Nastasya's body. He "
                 'has killed her and laid her on a bed. She is covered with '
                 'good leather and surrounded by bottles of uncorked '
                 'disinfectant. Myshkin ministers to the feverish Rogozhin, '
                 'soothing his brow and cheeks, and when the two are '
                 'discovered, Rogozhin is babbling and Myshkin has lost his '
                 'sanity. Eventually Rogozhin recovers from brain fever and is '
                 'tried and sentenced to Siberia. Myshkin is taken back to Dr. '
                 "Schneider's sanitarium in Switzerland; the possibilities for "
                 'his ever recovering are slight.',

{'author': 'Homer',
 'book_title': 'The Iliad',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Achaians, under King Agamemnon, have been fighting the '
                 'Trojans off and on for nine years, trying to retrieve Helen, '
                 "the wife of Menelaos, and thus Agamemnon's sister-in-law. "
                 'Paris, a son of the king of Troy, kidnaps Helen, who becomes '
                 'the legendary "Helen of Troy" and "the woman with the face '
                 'that launched a thousand ships." Yet, after years of Achaian '
                 'attacks, Troy remains intact, and the Trojan army remains '
                 'undefeated. The same cannot be said for the Achaian army. At '
                 'present, the Achaian troops are dying from a mysterious '
                 'plague. Hundreds of funeral pyres burn nightly. Finally, '
                 "Achilles, the Achaians' most honored soldier, calls for an "
                 'assembly to determine the cause of the plague. A soothsayer '
                 "reveals to the army that King Agamemnon's arrogance caused "
                 'the deadly plague; he refused to return a woman who was '
                 'captured and awarded to him as a "war prize." Reluctantly, '
                 'Agamemnon agrees to return the woman, but, as compensation, '
                 'he says that he will take the woman who was awarded to '
                 'Achilles, his best warrior. Achilles is furious, and he '
                 'refuses to fight any longer for the Achaians. He and his '
                 'forces retreat to the beach beside their ships, and Achilles '
                 'asks his mother, the goddess Thetis, if she will ask Zeus, '
                 'king of the gods, to help the Trojans defeat his former '
                 'comrades, the Achaians. Zeus agrees to do so. The two armies '
                 'prepare for battle, and Paris (the warrior who kidnapped '
                 "Menelaos' wife, Helen) leaps out and challenges any of the "
                 'Achaians to a duel. Menelaos challenges him and beats him, '
                 'but before Paris is killed, the goddess Aphrodite whisks him '
                 'away to the safety of his bedroom in Troy. A short truce is '
                 'called, but it is broken when an over-zealous soldier wounds '
                 'Menelaos. During the battle that follows, Diomedes, an '
                 'Achaian, dominates the action, killing innumerable Trojans '
                 'and wounding Aphrodite, a goddess. The Trojans seem to be '
                 'losing, so Hektor returns to Troy to ask his mother to offer '
                 'sacrifices to Athena. She performs the rituals, but Athena '
                 'refuses to accept them. Meanwhile, Hektor discovers Paris '
                 'safe in his bedroom with Helen, and shames him into '
                 'returning to battle. Then Hektor visits with his wife and '
                 'their baby son. It is clear that Hektor is deeply devoted to '
                 'his family, yet feels the terrible weight of his '
                 'responsibility as commander-in-chief of the Trojan army. '
                 'During the fighting that continues, the Achaians begin to '
                 "falter, and at one point Athena, Zeus' daughter, fears that "
                 'the entire Achaian army may be slaughtered. Thus, she and '
                 "Apollo decide to have Hektor challenge one of the Achaian' "
                 'warriors to a duel in order to settle the war. Telamonian '
                 'Aias (Ajax) battles Hektor so valiantly that the contest '
                 'ends in a draw, and a truce is called. During this break in '
                 'the fighting, the dead of both armies are buried and given '
                 'appropriate funeral rites, and the Achaians fortify their '
                 'defenses with a strong wall and a moat-like ditch. The '
                 'fighting resumes, and so many Achaians are slaughtered that '
                 'Agamemnon suggests that his troops sail for home, but '
                 'finally he is convinced that he must return to the fighting. '
                 'Messengers are sent to Achilles, asking him to return to '
                 'battle, but Achilles is still sulking beside his ships and '
                 'refuses to fight. Soon Agamemnon, Diomedes, Odysseus, and '
                 'old Nestor are all seriously wounded, and Achilles realizes '
                 'that the Achaians are in danger of imminent defeat. '
                 'Therefore, he sends his warrior-companion, Patroklos, to '
                 'find out who the seriously wounded are. Patroklos talks with '
                 'old Nestor, one of the wisest of the Achaian soldiers. '
                 "Nestor asks Patroklos to dress in Achilles' armor and return "
                 'to battle. The Achaians, he says, will rejoice and have new '
                 'faith in their death struggle against the Trojans when they '
                 'think that they see Achilles returning to the battle. In '
                 'addition, the Trojans will so fear the wrath of the mighty '
                 'Achilles that they will be easily defeated. Patroklos '
                 'promises to ask Achilles for permission to use his armor and '
                 'ride into battle disguised as the mighty warrior. Meanwhile, '
                 'Hektor leads a massive Trojan surge against the Achaian wall '
                 'that stands between the Trojans and the Achaian fleet of '
                 'ships, and the wall is successfully smashed. The tumult is '
                 'so deafening that hell itself seems unloosed. Achilles is '
                 'watching and realizes that his wish may be granted: The '
                 'Achaians are about to be annihilated. He sends Patroklos '
                 'into the fighting, disguised as Achilles himself. The '
                 'Achaian army rejoices at what they think is the return of '
                 'Achilles to the fighting, and the Trojans are so terrified '
                 'that they are quickly swept back to the walls of Troy. '
                 "Patroklos' valor seems superhuman. He has killed nine "
                 'Trojans in a single charge when Apollo strikes him with such '
                 'fury that Hektor is able to catch him off-guard and thrust a '
                 'spear through his body. Then some of the most intense '
                 "fighting of the war follows in a battle to claim Patroklos' "
                 "body. Finally, the Achaians rescue Patroklos' corpse, and "
                 "Hektor captures Achilles' armor. Then the Achaians return to "
                 'the beach, guarding their ships as best they can. Achilles '
                 'is filled with overwhelming grief and rage when he learns '
                 'that his warrior-companion, Patroklos, has been slaughtered. '

                 "Patroklos' death, she will outfit him in a suit of new "
                 'armor, made by one of the gods. Achilles chooses: He will '
                 'defy certain death and the Trojans in an attempt to punish '
                 'them for what they (and he) did to Patroklos. Thus, he '
                 'returns to battle in his new armor and is so successful that '

                 "Hektor's parents are so grieved at the barbaric treatment "
                 "given to their son's corpse that Priam, Hektor's father, "
                 "goes to Achilles and begs for his son's body. Achilles is "
                 "moved by Priam's pleas and by the memory of his own father. "
                 "Consequently, he agrees to cleanse and return Hektor's body. "

 'summary_text': 'The play begins in the flat of wealthy Algernon Moncrieff '
                 "(Algy) in London's fashionable West End. Algernon's aunt "
                 '(Lady Bracknell) and her daughter (Gwendolen Fairfax) are '
                 'coming for a visit, but Mr. Jack Worthing (a friend of '
                 "Algy's) arrives first. Algernon finds it curious that Jack "
                 'has announced himself as "Ernest." When Jack explains that '
                 'he plans to propose marriage to Gwendolen, Algy demands to '
                 'know why Jack has a cigarette case with the inscription, '
                 '"From little Cecily with her fondest love." Jack explains '
                 'that his real name is Jack Worthing, squire, in the country, '
                 'but he assumes the name "Ernest" when he ventures to the '
                 'city for fun. Cecily is his ward. While devouring all the '
                 'cucumber sandwiches, Algernon confesses that he, too, '
                 "employs deception when it's convenient. He visits an "
                 'imaginary invalid friend named Bunbury when he needs an '
                 'excuse to leave the city. Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen '
                 'arrive. Algernon explains that he cannot attend Lady '
                 "Bracknell's reception because he must visit his invalid "
                 'friend, Bunbury, but he offers to arrange the music for her '
                 'party. While Algernon distracts Lady Bracknell in another '
                 'room, Jack proposes to Gwendolen. Unfortunately, she '
                 'explains that she really wants to marry someone named Ernest '
                 'because it sounds so solidly aristocratic. However, she '
                 'accepts his proposal, and he makes a mental note to be '
                 'rechristened Ernest. Lady Bracknell returns and refutes the '
                 'engagement. She interrogates Jack and finds him lacking in '
                 'social status. On her way out, Lady Bracknell tells Jack '
                 'that he must find some acceptable parents. Gwendolen returns '
                 "for Jack's address in the country. Algernon overhears and "
                 'writes the address on his shirt cuff. He is curious about '
                 'Cecily and decides to go "bunburying" in the country. In the '
                 "second act, the scene shifts to Jack Worthing's country "
                 "estate where Miss Prism, Cecily Cardew's governess, is "
                 "teaching Cecily in the garden. Miss Prism sings Jack's "
                 'praises as a sensible and responsible man, unlike his '
                 'brother Ernest, who is wicked and has a weak character. She '
                 'teaches Cecily that good people end happily, and bad people '
                 'end unhappily, according to the romantic novel Miss Prism '
                 'wrote when she was young. The local vicar, Canon Chasuble, '
                 'arrives and, sensing an opportunity for romance, takes Miss '
                 'Prism for a walk in the garden. While they are gone, Algy '
                 "shows up pretending to be Jack's wicked brother Ernest. He "
                 "is overcome by Cecily's beauty. Determined to learn more "
                 'about Cecily while Jack is absent, Algernon plans to stay '
                 'for the weekend, then make a fast getaway before Jack '
                 'arrives on Monday. However, Jack returns early in mourning '
                 'clothes claiming that his brother Ernest has died in Paris. '
                 'He is shocked to find Algy there posing as Ernest. He orders '
                 'a dogcart — a small horse-drawn carriage — to send Algy back '
                 'to London, but it is too late. Algernon is in love with '
                 'Cecily and plans to stay there. When Jack goes out, Algernon '
                 'proposes to Cecily, who gets out a diary and letters that '
                 'she has already written, explaining that she had already '
                 'imagined their engagement. She has always wanted to marry '
                 'someone named Ernest, so Algy, like Jack, needs to arrange a '
                 'rechristening. Just when it seems that Jack and Algernon '
                 "couldn't get into worse trouble, Gwendolen arrives, pursuing "
                 'Jack, and discovers that his ward, Cecily, is unpleasantly '
                 'beautiful. In conversation, they discover that they are both '
                 'engaged to Ernest Worthing. A battle follows, cleverly '
                 'carried out during the British tea ceremony. The situation '
                 'is tense. Jack and Algernon arrive, and, in attempting to '
                 'straighten out the Ernest problem, they alienate both women. '
                 'The two men follow, explaining that they are going to be '
                 'rechristened Ernest, and the women relent and agree to stay '
                 'engaged. Lady Bracknell shows up demanding an explanation '
                 "for the couples' plans. When she discovers the extent of "
                 "Cecily's fortune, she gives her consent to her engagement to "
                 "Algernon; however, Jack's parentage is still a stumbling "
                 'block to her blessings. Jack tells Lady Bracknell that he '
                 "will not agree to Cecily's engagement until she is of age "
                 '(35) unless he can marry Gwendolen. Dr. Chasuble arrives and '
                 'announces that all is ready for the christenings. Jack '
                 'explains that the christenings will no longer be necessary. '
                 "Noting that Jack's present concerns are secular, the "
                 'minister states that he will return to the church where Miss '
                 'Prism is waiting to see him. Shocked at hearing the name '
                 '"Prism," Lady Bracknell immediately calls for Prism and '
                 "reveals her as the governess who lost Lady Bracknell's "
                 'nephew 28 years earlier on a walk with the baby carriage. '
                 'She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism explains '
                 'that in a moment of distraction she placed the baby in her '
                 'handbag and left him in Victoria Station, confusing him with '
                 'her three-volume novel, which was placed in the baby '
                 'carriage. After Jack asks for details, he quickly runs to '
                 'his room and retrieves the handbag. Miss Prism identifies '
                 "it, and Lady Bracknell reveals that Jack is Algernon's older "
                 'brother, son of Ernest John Moncrieff, who died years ago in '
                 'India. Jack now truly is Ernest, and Algernon/Cecily, '
                 "Jack/Gwendolen, and Chasuble/Prism fall into each others' "
                 'arms as Jack realizes the importance of being earnest.',

 'summary_text': 'Orphaned as an infant, Jane Eyre lives with at Gateshead '
                 'with her aunt, Sarah Reed, as the novel opens. Jane is ten '
                 'years old, an outsider in the Reed family. Her female '
                 "cousins, Georgiana and Eliza, tolerate, but don't love her. "
                 'Their brother, John, is more blatantly hostile to Jane, '
                 'reminding her that she is a poor dependent of his mother who '
                 "shouldn't even be associating with the children of a "
                 'gentleman. One day he is angered to find Jane reading one of '
                 'his books, so he takes the book away and throws it at her. '
                 'Finding this treatment intolerable, Jane fights back. She is '
                 'blamed for the conflagration and sent to the red-room, the '
                 'place where her kind Uncle Reed died. In this frightening '
                 "room, Jane thinks she sees her uncle's ghost and begs to be "
                 'set free. Her Aunt Reed refuses, insisting Jane remain in '
                 'her prison until she learns complete submissiveness. When '
                 'the door to the red-room is locked once again, Jane passes '
                 'out. She wakes back in her own room, with the kind '
                 'physician, Mr. Lloyd, standing over her bed. He advises Aunt '
                 'Reed to send Jane away to school, because she is obviously '
                 'unhappy at Gateshead. Jane is sent to Lowood School, a '
                 'charity institution for orphan girls, run by Mr. '
                 'Brocklehurst. A stingy and mean-hearted minister, '
                 'Brocklehurst provides the girls with starvation levels of '
                 'food, freezing rooms, and poorly made clothing and shoes. He '
                 'justifies his poor treatment of them by saying that they '
                 'need to learn humility and by comparing them to the '
                 'Christian martyrs, who also endured great hardships. Despite '
                 'the difficult conditions at Lowood, Jane prefers school to '
                 'life with the Reeds. Here she makes two new friends: Miss '
                 'Temple and Helen Burns. From Miss Temple, Jane learns proper '
                 'ladylike behavior and compassion; from Helen she gains a '
                 "more spiritual focus. The school's damp conditions, combined "
                 "with the girls' near-starvation diet, produces a typhus "
                 'epidemic, in which nearly half the students die, including '
                 "Helen Burns, who dies in Jane's arms. Following this "
                 'tragedy, Brocklehurst is deposed from his position as '
                 'manager of Lowood, and conditions become more acceptable. '
                 'Jane quickly becomes a star student, and after six years of '
                 'hard work, an effective teacher. Following two years of '
                 'teaching at Lowood, Jane is ready for new challenges. Miss '
                 'Temple marries, and Lowood seems different without her. Jane '
                 'places at advertisement for a governess position in the '
                 'local newspaper. She receives only one reply, from a Mrs. '
                 'Fairfax of Thornfield, near Millcote, who seeks a governess '
                 'for a ten-year old girl. Jane accepts the job. At '
                 'Thornfield, a comfortable three-story country estate, Jane '
                 'is warmly welcomed. She likes both her new pupil, Adèle '
                 'Varens, and Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper at Thornfield, but '
                 'is soon restless. One January afternoon, while walking to '
                 'Millcote to mail a letter, Jane helps a horseman whose horse '
                 'has slipped on a patch of ice and fallen. Returning to '
                 'Thornfield, Jane discovers that this man is Edward Fairfax '
                 'Rochester, the owner of Thornfield and her employer. He is a '
                 'dark-haired, moody man in his late thirties. Although he is '
                 'often taciturn, Jane grows fond of his mysterious, '
                 "passionate nature. He tells Jane about Adèle's mother, "
                 'Céline, a Parisian opera-singer who was once his mistress. '
                 'Adèle, he claims, is not his daughter, but he rescued the '
                 'poor girl after her mother abandoned her. Jane also '
                 'discovers that Thornfield harbors a secret. From time to '
                 'time, she hears strange, maniacal laughter coming from the '
                 'third story. Mrs. Fairfax claims this is just Grace Poole, '
                 'an eccentric servant with a drinking problem. But Jane '
                 'wonders if this is true. One night, Jane smells smoke in the '
                 "hallway, and realizes it is coming from Rochester's room. "
                 'Jane races down to his room, discovering his curtains and '
                 'bed are on fire. Unable to wake Rochester, she douses both '
                 'him and his bedding with cold water. He asks her not to tell '
                 'anyone about this incident and blames the arson on Grace '
                 "Poole. Why doesn't he press charges on Grace, or at least "
                 'evict her from the house, Jane wonders. Following this '
                 'incident, Rochester leaves suddenly for a house party at a '
                 'local estate. Jane is miserable during his absence and '
                 'realizes she is falling in love with him. After a weeklong '
                 'absence, he returns with a party of guests, including the '
                 'beautiful Blanche Ingram. Jane jealously believes Rochester '
                 'is pursing this accomplished, majestic, dark-haired beauty. '
                 "An old friend of Rochester's, Richard Mason, joins the party "
                 'one day. From him, Jane learns that Rochester once lived in '
                 'Spanish Town, Jamaica. One night, Mason is mysteriously '
                 'attacked, supposedly by the crazy Grace Poole. Jane leaves '
                 'Thornfield for a month to attend her aunt, who is on her '
                 "deathbed following her son John's excessive debauchery and "
                 'apparent suicide. Jane tries to create a reconciliation with '
                 "her aunt, but the woman refuses all Jane's attempts at "
                 'appeasement. Before dying, she gives Jane a letter from her '
                 'uncle, John Eyre, who had hoped to adopt Jane and make her '
                 'his heir. The letter was sent three years ago, but Aunt Reed '
                 'had vindictively kept it from Jane. Sarah Reed dies, unloved '
                 'by her daughters. When Jane returns to Thornfield, the '
                 'houseguests have left. Rochester tells Jane he will soon '
                 'marry Blanche, so she and Adèle will need to leave '
                 'Thornfield. In the middle of this charade, Jane reveals her '
                 'love for him, and the two end up engaged. Jane is happy to '
                 'be marrying the man she loves, but during the month before '
                 'the wedding she is plagued by strange dreams of a destroyed '
                 'Thornfield and a wailing infant. Two nights before the '
                 'wedding, a frightening, dark-haired woman enters her room '
                 'and rips her wedding veil in two. Although Jane is certain '
                 "this woman didn't look like Grace Poole, Rochester assures "
                 'her it must have been the bizarre servant. The morning of '
                 'the wedding finally arrives. Jane and Rochester stand at the '
                 'altar, taking their vows, when suddenly a strange man '
                 "announces there's an impediment to the marriage: Rochester "
                 'is already married to a woman named Bertha Antoinetta Mason. '
                 'Rochester rushes the wedding party back to Thornfield, where '
                 'they find his insane and repulsive wife locked in a room on '
                 "the third story. Grace Poole is the woman's keeper, but "
                 'Bertha was responsible for the strange laughter and violence '
                 'at Thornfield. Rochester tries to convince Jane to become '
                 'his mistress and move with him to a pleasure villa in the '
                 'south of France. Instead, Jane sneaks away in the middle of '
                 'the night, with little money and no extra clothing. With '
                 'twenty shillings, the only money she has, she catches a '
                 'coach that takes her to faraway Whitcross. There, she spends '
                 'three days roaming the woods, looking for work and, finally, '
                 'begging for food. On the third night, she follows a light '
                 'that leads her across the moors to Marsh End (also called '
                 'Moor House), owned by the Rivers family. Hannah, the '
                 'housekeeper, wants to send her away, but St. John Rivers, '
                 'the clergyman who owns the house, offers her shelter. Jane '
                 "soon becomes close friends with St. John's sisters, Diana "
                 'and Mary, and he offers Jane a humble job as the '
                 'schoolmistress for the poor girls in his parish at Morton. '
                 'Because their father lost most of his money before he died, '
                 'Diana and Mary have been forced to earn a living by working '
                 'as governesses. One day, St. John learns that, unbeknownst '
                 'to her, Jane has inherited 20,000 pounds from her uncle, '
                 "John Eyre. Furthermore, she discovers that St. John's real "
                 'name is St. John Eyre Rivers, so he, his sisters, and Jane '
                 "are cousins. The Rivers were cut out of John Eyre's will "
                 'because of an argument between John and their father. '
                 'Thrilled to discover that she has a family, Jane insists on '
                 'splitting the inheritance four ways, and then remodels Moor '
                 'House for her cousins, who will no longer need to work as '
                 'governesses. Not content with his life as a smalltime '
                 'clergyman, St. John plans to become a missionary in India. '
                 'He tries to convince Jane to accompany him, as his wife. '
                 "Realizing that St. John doesn't love her but just wants to "
                 'use her to accomplish his goals, Jane refuses his request, '
                 'but suggests a compromise by agreeing to follow him to India '
                 'as a comrade, but not as a wife. St. John tries to coerce '
                 'her into the marriage, and has almost succeeded, when, one '
                 "night Jane suddenly hears Rochester's disembodied voice "
                 'calling out to her. Jane immediately leaves Moor House to '
                 'search for her true love, Rochester. Arriving at Millcote, '
                 'she discovers Thornfield a burned wreck, just as predicted '
                 'in her dreams. From a local innkeeper, she learns that '
                 'Bertha Mason burned the house down one night and that '
                 'Rochester lost an eye and a hand while trying to save her '
                 'and the servants. He now lives in seclusion at Ferndean. '
                 'Jane immediately drives to Ferndean. There she discovers a '

                 'reveals her identity. The two lovers are joyfully reunited '
                 'and soon marry. Ten years later, Jane writes this narrative. '
                 'Her married life is still blissful; Adèle has grown to be a '
                 'helpful companion for Jane; Diana and Mary Rivers are '
                 'happily married; St. John still works as a missionary, but '

 'summary_text': 'Jude Fawley, an eleven-year-old boy, wants to follow the '
                 'example of his teacher Mr. Phillotson, who leaves Marygreen '
                 'for Christminster to take a university degree and to be '
                 'ordained. Jude is being raised by his great-aunt, whom he '
                 'helps in her bakery. He studies very hard on his own to '
                 'prepare for the move, and to provide a means by which he can '
                 'support himself at the university, he learns the trade of '
                 'ecclesiastical stonework. He meets, desires, and marries '
                 'Arabella Donn, who deceives him into marriage by making him '
                 'think he has got her pregnant. They do not get along at all, '
                 'and eventually Arabella leaves him to go with her family to '
                 'Australia. Though delayed, Jude does get to Christminster, '
                 'partly because of his aspirations but also partly because of '
                 'the presence there of his cousin Sue Bridehead. He meets and '
                 'falls in love with her, though the fact of his being married '
                 'causes him to feel guilty. Sue will not return his love, and '
                 'when he realizes that Phillotson, under whom she is now '
                 'teaching, is interested in Sue, Jude is in despair. This '
                 'plus the fact that he has made no headway on getting into '
                 'the university and realizes he never will causes him to give '
                 'up that part of his dream and leave Christminster. At '
                 'Melchester he intends to pursue theological study and '
                 'eventually enter the church at a lower level. Sue is there '
                 'at a training college and is to marry Phillotson when she '
                 'finishes, but she flees the school when punished for staying '
                 'out all night with Jude. Jude is puzzled by Sue because her '
                 'ideas are different from his and she will not return the '
                 'feeling he has for her. Shortly after he tells her he is '
                 'married, she announces her marriage to Phillotson and asks '
                 'Jude to give her away. He sees Arabella again, who is back '
                 'from abroad, spends the night with her, and learns that she '
                 'married in Australia. When he next encounters Sue, she tells '
                 "him perhaps she shouldn't have married, and Jude vows to go "
                 'on seeing her in spite of his aim to discipline himself to '
                 "get into the church. When Jude's aunt dies, Sue comes to "
                 'Marygreen for the funeral, and there she admits to him she '
                 "is unhappy and can't give herself to Phillotson. The kiss "
                 'Jude and Sue exchange when she leaves for Shaston causes him '
                 'to think he has reached the point where he is no longer fit '
                 'for the church; therefore, he burns his theological books '
                 'and will profess nothing. Sue asks Phillotson to let her '
                 'live apart from him, preferably with Jude, but he only '
                 'allows her to live apart in the house until an instance of '
                 'her repugnance to him causes him to decide to let her go. '
                 'Sue goes to Jude and they travel to Aldbrickham, but she '
                 'will not yet allow intimacy. Phillotson is dismissed from '
                 'his job at Shaston when Sue never returns, and after seeing '
                 'her later and not being able to get her back he decides to '
                 'divorce her to give her complete freedom. After living '
                 'together a year at Aldbrickham Jude and Sue have still not '
                 'consummated their relationship, and though they repeatedly '
                 'plan to be married they never go through with it. Only when '
                 'Arabella appears and seems to threaten her hold on Jude does '
                 'Sue allow intimacy. Arabella marries Cartlett, her '
                 "Australian husband, again and sends to Jude her and Jude's "
                 'son, Little Father Time. When opinion turns against Jude and '
                 'Sue and he loses a job because of their reputation, they '
                 'decide to leave Aldbrickham, and they live in many places as '
                 'Jude works where he can find employment in anything other '
                 'than ecclesiastical work, which he decides to give up. They '
                 'now have two children of their own and another on the way. '
                 'Having seen Sue in Kennetbridge, Arabella, whose husband has '
                 'died, revives her interest in Jude, and when she encounters '
                 'Phillotson, who is now in Marygreen, she tells him he was '
                 'wrong to let Sue go. Jude, now ill and not working '
                 'regularly, wants to return to Christminster. They do return '
                 'to Christminster, arriving on a holiday, and Jude is upset '
                 'by his return to the city that has meant so much to him and '
                 'gives a speech to a street crowd in an attempt to explain '
                 'what his life has meant. Despairing talk by Sue triggers off '
                 'a reaction in Little Father Time, and he hangs the other two '
                 'children and himself. And the child Sue is carrying is born '
                 'dead. Jude and Sue have reached the point where their views '
                 'of life have about reversed, Jude becoming secular and Sue '
                 'religious; and when Phillotson writes to ask Sue to come '
                 'back to him, she agrees, thinking of it as a penance. Sue '
                 'returns to Phillotson at Marygreen and marries him again, '
                 'though she still finds him repugnant. Arabella comes to '
                 'Jude, and by persistent scheming she gets him to marry her '
                 'once more. They get along about as before, and though ill '
                 'Jude goes to see Sue and they declare their love for each '
                 'other. As a further penance, Sue then gives herself to '
                 'Phillotson. Jude learns of this, and on the holiday the '
                 'following year, while Arabella is out enjoying the '
                 'festivities, Jude dies. Only Arabella and Mrs. Edlin are '
                 'present to stand watch by his coffin.',

{'author': 'William Shakespeare',
 'book_title': 'Julius Caesar',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The action begins in February 44 BC. Julius Caesar has just '
                 'reentered Rome in triumph after a victory in Spain over the '
                 'sons of his old enemy, Pompey the Great. A spontaneous '
                 'celebration has interrupted and been broken up by Flavius '
                 'and Marullus, two political enemies of Caesar. It soon '
                 'becomes apparent from their words that powerful and secret '
                 'forces are working against Caesar. Caesar appears, attended '
                 'by a train of friends and supporters, and is warned by a '
                 'soothsayer to "beware the ides of March," but he ignores the '
                 'warning and leaves for the games and races marking the '
                 "celebration of the feast of Lupercal. After Caesar's "
                 'departure, only two men remain behind — Marcus Brutus, a '
                 'close personal friend of Caesar, and Cassius, a long time '
                 "political foe of Caesar's. Both men are of aristocratic "
                 'origin and see the end of their ancient privilege in '
                 "Caesar's political reforms and conquests. Envious of "
                 "Caesar's power and prestige, Cassius cleverly probes to "
                 "discover where Brutus' deepest sympathies lie. As a man of "
                 'highest personal integrity, Brutus opposes Caesar on '
                 'principle, despite his friendship with him. Cassius '
                 "cautiously inquires about Brutus' feelings if a conspiracy "
                 'were to unseat Caesar; he finds Brutus not altogether '
                 'against the notion; that is, Brutus shares "some aim" with '
                 'Cassius but does not wish "to be any further moved." The two '
                 'men part, promising to meet again for further discussions. '
                 'In the next scene, it is revealed that the conspiracy '
                 'Cassius spoke of in veiled terms is already a reality. He '
                 'has gathered together a group of disgruntled and discredited '
                 'aristocrats who are only too willing to assassinate Caesar. '
                 'Partly to gain the support of the respectable element of '
                 'Roman society, Cassius persuades Brutus to head the '
                 'conspiracy, and Brutus agrees to do so. Shortly afterward, '
                 "plans are made at a secret meeting in Brutus' orchard. The "
                 'date is set: It will be on the day known as the ides of '
                 'March, the fifteenth day of the month. Caesar is to be '
                 'murdered in the Senate chambers by the concealed daggers and '
                 'swords of the assembled conspirators. After the meeting is '
                 "ended, Brutus' wife, Portia, suspecting something and "
                 "fearing for her husband's safety, questions him. Touched by "
                 'her love and devotion, Brutus promises to reveal his secret '
                 "to her later. The next scene takes place in Caesar's house. "
                 'The time is the early morning; the date, the fateful ides of '
                 'March. The preceding night has been a strange one — wild, '
                 'stormy, and full of strange and unexplainable sights and '
                 "happenings throughout the city of Rome. Caesar's wife, "
                 'Calphurnia, terrified by horrible nightmares, persuades '
                 'Caesar not to go to the Capitol, convinced that her dreams '
                 'are portents of disaster. By prearrangement, Brutus and the '
                 'other conspirators arrive to accompany Caesar, hoping to '
                 'fend off any possible warnings until they have him totally '
                 'in their power at the Senate. Unaware that he is surrounded '
                 "by assassins and shrugging off Calphurnia's exhortations, "
                 "Caesar goes with them. Despite the conspirators' best "
                 "efforts, a warning is pressed into Caesar's hand on the very "
                 'steps of the Capitol, but he refuses to read it. Wasting no '
                 'further time, the conspirators move into action. Purposely '
                 'asking Caesar for a favor they know he will refuse, they '
                 'move closer, as if begging a favor, and then, reaching for '
                 'their hidden weapons, they kill him before the shocked eyes '
                 "of the senators and spectators. Hearing of Caesar's murder, "
                 "Mark Antony, Caesar's closest friend, begs permission to "
                 "speak at Caesar's funeral. Brutus grants this permission "
                 'over the objections of Cassius and delivers his own speech '
                 'first, confident that his words will convince the populace '
                 "of the necessity for Caesar's death. After Brutus leaves, "
                 "Antony begins to speak. The crowd has been swayed by Brutus' "
                 'words, and it is an unsympathetic crowd that Antony '
                 'addresses. Using every oratorical device known, however, '
                 'Antony turns the audience into a howling mob, screaming for '
                 "the blood of Caesar's murderers. Alarmed by the furor caused "
                 "by Antony's speech, the conspirators and their supporters "
                 'are forced to flee from Rome and finally, from Italy. At '
                 "this point, Antony, together with Caesar's young grandnephew "
                 'and adopted son, Octavius, and a wealthy banker, Lepidus, '
                 "gathers an army to pursue and destroy Caesar's killers. "
                 'These three men, known as triumvirs , have formed a group '
                 'called the Second Triumvirate to pursue the common goal of '
                 'gaining control of the Roman Empire. Months pass, during '
                 'which the conspirators and their armies are pursued '
                 'relentlessly into the far reaches of Asia Minor. When '
                 'finally they decide to stop at the town of Sardis, Cassius '
                 'and Brutus quarrel bitterly over finances. Their differences '
                 'are resolved, however, and plans are made to meet the forces '
                 'of Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus in one final battle. '
                 'Against his own better judgment, Cassius allows Brutus to '
                 'overrule him: Instead of holding to their well-prepared '
                 "defensive positions, Brutus orders an attack on Antony's "
                 'camp on the plains of Philippi. Just before the battle, '
                 'Brutus is visited by the ghost of Caesar. "I shall see thee '
                 'at Philippi," the spirit warns him, but Brutus\' courage is '
                 'unshaken and he goes on. The battle rages hotly. At first, '
                 'the conspirators appear to have the advantage, but in the '
                 'confusion, Cassius is mistakenly convinced that all is lost, '
                 'and he kills himself. Leaderless, his forces are quickly '
                 'defeated, and Brutus finds himself fighting a hopeless '
                 'battle. Unable to face the prospect of humiliation and shame '
                 "as a captive (who would be chained to the wheels of Antony's "
                 'chariot and dragged through the streets of Rome), he too '
                 'takes his own life. As the play ends, Antony delivers a '
                 'eulogy over Brutus\' body, calling him "the noblest Roman of '
                 'them all." Caesar\'s murder has been avenged, order has been '
                 'restored, and, most important, the Roman Empire has been '
                 'preserved.',

{'author': 'William Shakespeare',
 'book_title': 'King Henry IV, Part 1',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The main plot of Henry IV, Part 1 is about the rebellion of '
                 'the Percies, the northern baronial family who had helped '
                 'Henry depose Richard II and become king. They are joined by '
                 'the Scottish Earl of Douglas, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of '
                 'March, claimant to the throne, and Owen Glendower, a Welsh '
                 'noble. Henry is presented first as a ruler who has been '
                 'beset with troubles from the start: civil unrest in England, '
                 'attacks by Scottish forces moving across the northern '
                 'border, and the defeat and capture of the still-loyal '
                 'Mortimer by Glendower. He thus is unable to fulfill his '
                 'earlier vow to lead a crusade to the Holy Land. But there is '
                 'one piece of good news: English forces led by young Hotspur '
                 'have defeated the Scots at Holmedon and have captured the '
                 'renowned Earl of Douglas. Yet this especially gives the '
                 'harassed king reason to lament the dereliction of his son '
                 'and heir, Prince Henry, who persistently has avoided the '
                 'court and public responsibility and spends his time in the '
                 'company of the elderly, high-spirited Sir John Falstaff, as '
                 "well as the lowly patrons of the Boar's-Head Tavern in "
                 'Eastcheap. The comic subplot deals most amusingly with this '
                 'same Falstaff and his companions, including Prince Hal, as '
                 'he is appropriately called in this setting. In the initial '
                 'episode, Hal joins with Poins, Bardolph, and Peto in a plan '
                 'to jokingly deceive Falstaff, contriving to have him '
                 'participate in a robbery at Gadshill, be robbed in turn, and '
                 'finally exposed as a coward and liar. Alone, Prince Hal '
                 'soliloquizes, letting the audience know that, although he '
                 'now chooses to enjoy himself in riotous company, he has no '
                 'illusions about the character of his associates and will '
                 'redeem himself publicly at the proper time. The main plot '
                 'takes precedence at this point. Once more at the court, King '
                 'Henry confronts the Percies-Northumberland, Worcester, and '
                 'Hotspur. He sternly scolds them and especially demands to be '
                 'told why the ranking Scottish prisoners taken by Hotspur '
                 'have not been turned over to the Crown. The Percies, deeply '
                 'resenting the fact that the man they helped to the throne '
                 'now intends to enforce absolute obedience, begin to plot '
                 'their revolt. They will make peace with Glendower and gain '
                 'his support and that of Mortimer. Then, aided by Welsh and '
                 'Scottish forces, the latter led by Douglas, they will war '
                 'against the usurper, King Henry IV. The comic subplot now '
                 'gains center stage. Arrangements are completed for the '
                 'robbery at Gadshill during the night. When the victims, a '
                 'group of travelers, approach, Poins and the prince use an '
                 'excuse to separate themselves from Falstaff and the others. '
                 'Falstaff, forced to proceed on foot, is the leader of the '
                 'robbers, who then are set upon by the disguised prince and '
                 'Poins and robbed in turn. Falstaff quickly beats a retreat. '
                 'Again the action shifts to the main plot. Hotspur reads a '
                 'letter from an English noble whose aid he has solicited. He '
                 'can hardly contain himself as he reads the excuses offered, '
                 'and he denounces the writer as a coward. Then, in an '
                 'exchange with his attractive young wife, Kate, he reveals '
                 'himself as a man practically obsessed with matters relating '
                 'solely to the planned revolt against the Crown. In Eastcheap '
                 "at the Boar's-Head Tavern, Falstaff is exposed as the dupe "
                 'who has been tricked by the prince and Poins. But, not '
                 'unexpectedly, in view of his already demonstrated wit, he '
                 'not only survives the ordeal of being laughed at as a coward '
                 'and liar but emerges comically triumphant. Prior to all '
                 'this, Hal had made satiric reference to the ability of '
                 'Hotspur; now an emissary from the king informs Hal that he '
                 'must appear at court promptly. This turn of events provides '
                 'the prince the opportunity to participate with Falstaff in a '
                 '"play extempore," each successively enacting the role of '
                 'King Henry rebuking the wayward son and heir. At the '
                 'residence of the Archdeacon in North Wales, Hotspur, '
                 'Worcester, Mortimer, and Glendower hold a parley, one not '
                 'without some disagreement. They plan the campaign against '
                 'the royal forces and the later division of England into '
                 'three parts. The absence of the Earl of Northumberland is '
                 'significant in light of later events. In the meantime, the '
                 'confrontation between the king and Prince Hal takes place, '
                 'the former sternly rebuking his son and comparing him '
                 'unfavorably to the valiant Hotspur. But when Hal soberly '
                 "vows to redeem his tarnished reputation at Hotspur's "
                 'expense, the king not only forgives him but places him in '
                 'command of royal forces. At that very moment the two learn '
                 'that the rebels will be assembled at Shrewsbury. Once more '
                 "the action shifts to the Boar's-Head Tavern, where Falstaff "
                 'is flourishing in the company of Bardolph and Mistress '
                 'Quickly. The prince and Peto arrive, and we learn that Hal '
                 'has reimbursed the travelers who had been robbed at Gadshill '
                 "and has arranged for Falstaff's commissioning as a leader of "
                 "the king's forces. Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas learn "
                 'that the Earl of Northumberland and his retainers will not '
                 'join them. Apparently illness has incapacitated him. But '
                 'Hotspur is not upset by this bad news; sure of victory, he '
                 'sees this as providing a greater opportunity to impress the '
                 'multitude, whose support the rebels must gain and retain. '
                 'Vernon arrives with the news that the royal army has set '
                 'forth for Shrewsbury and that second in command to the king '
                 'himself is the Prince of Wales. Hotspur, at first depressed '
                 "by Vernon's glowing description of Hal, quickly recovers "
                 'himself and declares that he will fight the prince in single '
                 'combat. Yet a third report is received: Glendower will '
                 'require fourteen days to raise a force of Welshmen. But '
                 'nothing can dampen the eagerness nor restrain the '
                 'impulsiveness of Hotspur. Next we see Falstaff as a military '
                 'commander. He has managed to enlist a group of pitiful, '
                 'physically unfit "soldiers" whom he will lead to Shrewsbury. '
                 'Both Prince Hal and Westmoreland remark on their unfitness '
                 'but do nothing to stop Falstaff. Sir Walter Blunt, emissary '
                 'from King Henry, arrives in the rebel camp and addresses the '
                 'rebel leaders, voicing the conventional condemnation of '
                 "their disloyalty and conveying to them the king's "
                 'willingness to listen to their grievances. Hotspur restates '
                 "the rebels' arguments, and the royal offer is rejected. In "
                 'Yorkshire, the Archbishop of York and one Sir Michael, both '
                 'sympathetic to the rebellious Percies, discuss the upcoming '
                 'battle at Shrewsbury. Learning that Mortimer and his battle '
                 'forces will not be able to join the rebels, the archbishop '
                 'expresses his deep concern for the success of the '
                 'enterprise. He directs Sir Michael to leave at once to '
                 'enlist support because he knows that King Henry, aware of '
                 'his disloyalty, will move against him "if Lord Percy thrive '
                 'not." The action now moves to the king\'s camp at '
                 'Shrewsbury. There, Worcester and Vernon meet with Henry IV, '
                 'are given a chance once more to voice their grievances, are '
                 'lectured on the subject of loyalty, and are offered generous '
                 'terms if they will disband their forces. Prince Hal speaks '
                 'words of praise for Hotspur, modestly concedes that he '
                 'himself has been derelict, and offers to fight his rival in '
                 'single combat. The two rebel leaders depart, supposedly to '
                 'report to Hotspur what has been said by the king and prince. '
                 'Present during all this is Sir John Falstaff, who, left to '
                 'himself, soliloquizes on the impractical aspects of heroism '
                 'and honor. Worcester does not tell his nephew about the '
                 "king's offer, convinced that under any circumstances the "
                 "older leaders of the revolt will be the objects of Henry's "
                 'wrath. But Vernon reports honestly and clearly to Hotspur '
                 'how Prince Hal conducted himself. When a messenger announces '
                 'the approach of the royal forces, Hotspur sounds the call to '
                 'battle. In the course of that battle, Douglas kills Blunt, '
                 'mistaking him for the king, and he exchanges words of '
                 'warlike determination with Hotspur. A contrast is provided '
                 'by Falstaff, who suddenly appears after the two have left. '
                 'We learn that he has committed his tattered troops to '
                 'battle, wherein they, with the exception of one or two, have '
                 'been slaughtered. When the prince appears, deadly serious, '
                 'Falstaff employs his verbal wit once more and is sternly '
                 'rebuked. Prince Hal rescues his father from the sword of '
                 'Douglas and meets and slays his great rival, Hotspur. After '
                 "the prince's departure for another part of the battlefield, "
                 'Falstaff reappears. Then, when Hal returns with his brother, '
                 'Prince John of Lancaster, Falstaff claims to have killed the '
                 'young rebel leader. Neither of the princes bothers to refute '
                 'him at any length. Worcester and Vernon are captured and '
                 'later put to death. But Douglas, also a captive, is set free '
                 'by the generous Prince Hal. The rebel forces have been badly '
                 'defeated. King Henry then dispatches John of Lancaster to '
                 'the North, where he will oppose Northumberland and the '
                 'Archbishop Scroop; he himself will leave with Prince Hal to '
                 'fight the forces led by Glendower and Mortimer.',

{'author': 'William Shakespeare',
 'book_title': 'King Lear',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'King Lear opens with a conversation between the earls of '
                 'Kent and Gloucester, in which the audience learns that '
                 'Gloucester has two sons: Edgar, who is his legitimate heir, '
                 'and Edmund, his younger illegitimate son. This information '
                 'will provide the secondary or subplot. Next, King Lear '
                 'enters to state that he intends to remove himself from '
                 "life's duties and concerns. Pointing at a map, Lear tells "
                 'those in attendance that he has divided his kingdom into '
                 'three shares, to be parceled out to his three daughters, as '
                 'determined by their protestations of love. The two elder '
                 'daughters, Goneril and Regan, exaggerate their love by '
                 'telling their father that their affection for him exceeds '
                 'all reasonable expectations. The youngest daughter, '
                 'Cordelia, tells Lear that she loves him, but only as a '
                 'daughter should love a father. Lear, angry and disappointed '
                 "at what he deems a lack of devotion on Cordelia's part, "
                 'divides his kingdom equally between Goneril and Regan, and '
                 'banishes Cordelia. Later, France agrees to marry the now '
                 'dowerless and banished Cordelia. When Kent attempts to '
                 'defend Cordelia, Lear banishes him as well. Meanwhile, '
                 'Goneril and Regan decide that if Lear becomes too much of a '
                 'nuisance, they will have to decide what disciplinary actions '
                 'to take. In the developing subplot, Edmund complains of his '
                 'unhappiness at being an illegitimate — and thus, '
                 'disinherited — son. As part of his plot to claim what is not '
                 'his, Edmund gives a false letter to his father, Gloucester, '
                 'declaring that Edgar is proposing that they kill their '
                 'father and split the wealth between them. The cunning Edmund '
                 'easily convinces his father that Edgar cannot be trusted. '
                 "Within a short time, Lear moves to Goneril's palace. Goneril "
                 'tells Lear that he needs a smaller troop, more decorous in '
                 "behavior and better suited to the king's rank and age. The "
                 'king is very angry and says he will pack up his people and '
                 "move to Regan's palace. Lear's anger continues to build, and "
                 "he calls upon nature to curse Goneril's womb. In response, "
                 "Goneril turns out 50 of Lear's retinue. As the subplot "
                 'develops, Edmund wounds himself slightly, pretending that '
                 'Edgar has attacked him. Certain that Edgar will also try to '
                 'kill him, Gloucester promises to find the means to make '
                 'Edmund his heir. After his escape into the woods, Edgar '
                 'decides that he will disguise himself as a Bedlam beggar, '
                 'who will be known as Poor Tom. Meanwhile, Cornwall orders an '
                 'impassioned Kent placed in the stocks. Lear arrives and '
                 'quickly realizes that Regan has joined Goneril in seeking to '
                 "reduce Lear's authority. Lear reminds his daughters that he "
                 'gave them all that they now enjoy, but they are unmoved. An '
                 'angry Lear calls for his horse, and rides into the storm '
                 'with his Fool for protection. Exposed to the storm, the Fool '
                 'attempts to reason with his king, but Lear will have no part '
                 'of submission, especially before his daughters. Soon the '
                 'king and Fool are joined by Edgar disguised as Poor Tom. '
                 'Gloucester tells Edmund of the plot to save the king, '
                 'unaware that he is divulging the plans to a traitor. Edmund '
                 'immediately resolves to tell Cornwall of the plan. Edmund '
                 "soon receives his reward: Gloucester's title and lands. The "
                 'captured Gloucester is tortured by Regan, who fiendishly '
                 'plucks at his beard, and Cornwall, who gouges out '
                 "Gloucester's eyes, but not before one of Cornwall's servants "
                 'draws a sword and stabs Cornwall, who soon dies of his '
                 'wounds. Later, Edgar is both shocked and dismayed when a '
                 'blinded Gloucester is led in by one of his tenants. The '
                 'disguised Edgar agrees to take Gloucester to the cliff he '
                 'seeks, where he dupes Gloucester into thinking that he is at '
                 'the edge of a precipice. After Gloucester jumps and loses '
                 'consciousness, Edgar easily convinces his father that he has '
                 'somehow survived a fall from the cliffs. Oswald arrives and '
                 'attempts to kill Gloucester but is, instead, slain by Edgar. '
                 'As he lays dying, Oswald gives Edgar a letter from Goneril '
                 'instructing Edmund to murder Albany so that she will be free '
                 'to wed Edmund. Goneril and Edmund soon learn that Albany is '
                 'a changed man, one who is pleased to learn of the proposed '
                 'invasion by France and displeased when he learns that '
                 'Gloucester has been replaced by his younger son, Edmund. '
                 "Meanwhile, Cordelia learns of her father's deteriorated "
                 'mental condition and returns to England with an army to '
                 'defend her father. Within a short time, Cordelia and her '
                 "father reunite. In spite of Albany's intent to save Lear and "
                 "Cordelia's lives, Edmund resolves that they will die. Edmund "
                 'orders that Lear and Cordelia be imprisoned. Albany, '
                 'Goneril, and Regan join Edmund, and a confrontation erupts '
                 "between all four characters. Edmund's treachery is revealed, "
                 'and he is wounded in a fight with Edgar, whom Edmund does '

 'summary_text': 'Opening in San Francisco in January 1990, an extended '
                 'Chinese-American family gathers for a dual purpose — an '
                 'engagement dinner and a funeral. The first narrator, Pearl '
                 'Louie Brandt, conceals a seven-year struggle with multiple '
                 'sclerosis from her widowed mother, Winnie. At the banquet, '
                 "Pearl learns that Helen, Winnie's best friend and co-owner "
                 'of a flower shop, knows about the disease and threatens to '
                 'pass the news to Winnie as part of the Chinese New Year '
                 'ritual of clearing the air of secrets. Pearl accepts the '
                 'fact that she herself must tell her mother about the '
                 "disease. The Buddhist funeral of Helen's Auntie Du releases "
                 'in Pearl the grief she has repressed for her father, Jimmy '
                 'Louie, a Baptist minister, who died a quarter century '
                 'earlier, when Pearl was fourteen. From Auntie Du, Pearl '
                 'inherits a table altar to the Kitchen God, a deceitful '
                 'husband and a judge of who gets good luck and who gets bad. '
                 'After the banquet and funeral, Helen shares with Winnie a '
                 "letter informing her that Wen Fu, Winnie's former abusive "
                 'husband, has died of heart disease. Just as Helen has '
                 "threatened to tell Pearl's secret to Winnie before the New "
                 'Year, Helen now threatens Winnie that she will tell Pearl '
                 "about Winnie's secret-filled life, now that Wen Fu is dead — "
                 'unless Winnie tells Pearl about it herself. That story, told '
                 "by Winnie to Pearl, is the novel's major focus, a long and "
                 'intense narrative, structured by many episodes: The gnawing '
                 "ache in Winnie's relationship with Pearl springs from "
                 "continual fear about Wen Fu, whom she suspects is Pearl's "
                 'father. Recalling the perverted joy Wen Fu took in abusing '
                 'them all, Winnie still grieves for Mochou, her stillborn '
                 'first daughter; for Yiku, her second daughter, who died '
                 "after Wen Fu's cruelty and neglect; and for Danru, who died "
                 'far from his mother while she was attempting to divorce Wen '
                 'Fu. Later, she sees in Pearl a likeness to all three of '
                 'these children. With gold given to her secretly by her mute, '
                 'ailing father and with encouragement from a rebellious '
                 'cousin and from Jimmy Louie, Weili (Winnie) makes plans to '
                 'flee not only her marriage, but also Shanghai and China. Wen '
                 'Fu foils the plot and has Weili arrested. At her trial, '
                 'Weili elects to spend two years in prison rather than return '
                 'to her impossible marriage. In the scandal stimulated by the '
                 'trial, Jimmy Louie loses his job as interpreter and must '
                 'return to the United States. He vows to return in two years, '
                 'and meanwhile he supports her with letters and gifts of '
                 "American dollars. Auntie Du obtains Weili's early release "
                 'from prison in the spring of 1949 by intimidating corrupt '
                 'officials. Through trickery, Weili forces Wen Fu to sign '
                 'divorce papers; Wen Fu avenges himself by stalking her, '
                 'ripping up the divorce papers, threatening to steal the '
                 'plane tickets, and raping Weili at gunpoint. She captures '
                 'his gun and forces him trouserless into the street. She '
                 'leaves China by plane the next day, narrowly escaping '
                 'occupation of Shanghai by the Communists, who ban all '
                 'emigration. She settles with Jimmy in California, fearful '
                 'that the child she bears may be the offspring of Wen Fu, '
                 'inheriting his evil traits. When Winnie concludes her life '
                 'story, Pearl ends a quarter-century of mother-daughter '
                 'alienation by disclosing her multiple sclerosis to her '
                 'mother. Plans form for a trip to China to seek herbal '
                 'treatments and cures. To seal their newfound comfort with '
                 'the truth, Winnie burns the picture of the cruel Kitchen God '
                 'and selects for Pearl a new icon for the red temple altar: '

 'summary_text': 'The Kite Runner is the story of Amir, a Sunni Muslim, who '
                 'struggles to find his place in the world because of the '
                 'aftereffects and fallout from a series of traumatic '
                 'childhood events. An adult Amir opens the novel in the '
                 'present-day United States with a vague reference to one of '
                 "these events, and then the novel flashes back to Amir's "
                 'childhood in Afghanistan. In addition to typical childhood '
                 'experiences, Amir struggles with forging a closer '
                 'relationship with his father, Baba; with determining the '
                 "exact nature of his relationship with Hassan, his Shi'a "
                 'Muslim servant; and eventually with finding a way to atone '
                 'for pre-adolescent decisions that have lasting '
                 'repercussions. Along the way, readers are able to experience '
                 'growing up in Afghanistan in a single-parent home, a '
                 'situation that bears remarkable similarities to many '
                 'contemporary households. One of the biggest struggles for '
                 'Amir is learning to navigate the complex socioeconomic '
                 'culture he faces, growing up in Afghanistan as a member of '
                 'the privileged class yet not feeling like a privileged '
                 'member of his own family. Hassan and his father, Ali, are '
                 "servants, yet at times, Amir's relationship with them is "
                 "more like that of family members. And Amir's father, Baba, "
                 'who does not consistently adhere to the tenets of his '
                 'culture, confuses rather than clarifies things for young '
                 'Amir. Many of the ruling-class elite in Afghanistan view the '
                 'world as black and white, yet Amir identifies many shades of '
                 'gray. In addition to the issues affecting his personal life, '
                 'Amir must also contend with the instability of the Afghan '
                 'political system in the 1970s. During a crucial episode, '
                 'which takes place during an important kite flying '
                 'tournament, Amir decides not to act — he decides not to '
                 'confront bullies and aggressors when he has the chance — and '
                 'this conscious choice of inaction sets off a chain reaction '
                 'that leads to guilt, lies, and betrayals. Eventually, '
                 'because of the changing political climate, Amir and his '
                 'father are forced to flee Afghanistan. Amir views coming to '
                 'America as an opportunity to leave his past behind. Although '
                 'Amir and Baba toil to create a new life for themselves in '
                 'the United States, the past is unable to stay buried. When '
                 'it rears its ugly head, Amir is forced to return to his '
                 'homeland to face the demons and decisions of his youth, with '
                 'only a slim hope to make amends. Ultimately, The Kite Runner '
                 'is a novel about relationships — specifically the '
                 'relationships between Amir and Hassan, Baba, Rahim Khan, '
                 'Soraya, and Sohrab — and how the complex relationships in '
                 'our lives overlap and connect to make us the people we are.',

                 'Knights at the Round Table. Arthur, who is son of King Uther '
                 'Pendragon but was raised by another family, takes his '
                 'rightful place as king when, as a boy, he is able to pull '
                 'the sword called Excalibur from the stone. Although he rules '
                 'wisely and is counseled by Merlin the magician, Arthur makes '
                 'enemies of other kings and is often at war. When Arthur '
                 'marries Genevere, her father gives Arthur the Round Table, '
                 'at which 150 men can sit. Genevere, who is often present at '
                 'the convening of the Round Table, acts as a moral compass '
                 'for the knights, rewarding knights who behave well and '
                 'chastising those who choose poorly. Malory specifically '
                 'relates the stories of Sir Gawain, Sir Tor, and Sir Pellanor '
                 'as a means of introducing the concept of chivalry. Arthur is '
                 'nearly betrayed by his sister Morgan le Fay, but he is '
                 'helped by Nineve, a sorceress who learned her magic powers '
                 'from Merlin before killing him. Arthur then fights the '
                 'Romans when Emperor Lucius of Rome demands that Arthur bow '
                 'to him. Although the war requires several battles, Arthur '
                 'and his knights win and return to Guinevere and the other '

                 'greatest knight in all the world by his virtue, loyalty, and '
                 "bravery. At the same time, Sir Gareth, Gawain's brother, "
                 'proves valiant in his adventures. Tristam (also known as '
                 'Tristan), who is son of King Melyodas de Lyones and the '
                 'sister of King Mark of Cornwall, is then introduced, and his '
                 'adventures unfold. He kills Sir Marhault to free his uncle '
                 'from a debt owed to King Angwyssh of Ireland, and then falls '
                 "in love with Isode (also known as Isolde), Angwyssh's "
                 "daughter. Isode marries Tristam's uncle Mark, but Tristam "
                 'and Isode remain lovers. Tristam is exiled by Mark, which '
                 'means he can no longer use his true identity; thus, he '
                 'fights as The Knight with the Black Shield. Tristam duels '
                 "and beats many of Arthur's knights, but is eventually thrown "
                 'in prison and becomes ill. He escapes and eventually meets '
                 'and fights Launcelot in a duel predicted by Merlin. They '
                 'become the best of friends. Launcelot, who is in love with '
                 'and completely loyal to Guinevere, rides one day in search '
                 'of adventure. He kills a dragon, sees the Grail, and is '
                 "tricked into lying with Pellas' daughter Elayne, with whom "
                 'he has a son, Galahad. Guinevere, upon hearing of the '
                 'affair, has Launcelot banished from court; Launcelot then '
                 'wanders from place to place in his grief. Elayne, through '
                 'her father, heals Launcelot through the Grail, and he '
                 'eventually returns joyously to Camelot and the Round Table. '
                 'Launcelot introduces his son, Galahad, to the court, and '
                 'Galahad takes the Sege Perilous, the seat at the Round Table '
                 'that no knight has been worthy enough to fill. Galahad also '
                 'draws the sword from the floating stone, establishing him as '
                 "the best knight in the world, but also accepting the sword's "
                 'curse — that it will later cause a grievous wound. Most of '
                 'the knights then set out separately on Grail Quest. During '

                 'Quest. Galahad, Percival, and Bors meet up and continue the '
                 'Grail Quest, but they are briefly parted. Launcelot and '
                 'Galahad continue to the Grail at Castle Corbenic, where '
                 'Launcelot is shown to be unworthy of the Quest. When Sir '
                 'Evelake dies after his embrace with Galahad, Galahad is '
                 'identified as the knight who will achieve the Grail Quest. '
                 'Galahad is made a king who dies shortly thereafter, while '
                 "Percival becomes a hermit. Bors returns to King Arthur's "
                 'court. Launcelot also returns to the court and continues his '
                 'love for Guinevere. After a series of trials, Guinevere is '
                 "convinced of Launcelot's love for her. Although Arthur knows "
                 'of the affair and overlooks it, he is prompted by Aggravain '
                 "and Mordred (Arthur's son by Lot's wife) to take action; "
                 'Guinevere is sentenced to be burned at the stake. Launcelot '
                 'rescues her and takes her to his castle, Joyous Gard, but in '
                 'the battle, Launcelot kills Gareth and Gaheris, who are at '
                 'the execution but are unarmed. Launcelot returns Guinevere '

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The story takes place in Paris in the year 1819, in a '
                 'decrepit, dirty, ill-smelling boardinghouse on the left bank '
                 'of the Seine. Mme. Vauquer, a stingy old widow who owns the '
                 'place, rules over her tenants. They are people with modest '
                 'means and desires, like Mlle. Michonneau, the old maid; '
                 'Poiret, a puppet-like human being; and a young orphan, '
                 'Victorine Taillefer. Three tenants stand out in this '
                 'company: Eugène de Rastignac, a young student from the '
                 'provinces, of noble origin, but poor and eager to try his '
                 'luck in the capital; Vautrin, the "strong" man, bon vivant '
                 'and humorous, but mysterious and alarming; and Père Goriot, '
                 'a retired merchant, who seems to be suffering from a '
                 'mysterious sorrow. Rastignac soon discovers that strange '
                 'events are taking place at the seemingly respectable '
                 'boardinghouse: Old Goriot pressing silver dishes into '
                 'ingots, Vautrin furtively returning to the house in the '
                 'middle of the night in spite of the bolted doors, Goriot '
                 'being visited by pretty girls whose bills he pays. Rastignac '
                 'is going to find out the solution of one of the mysteries. '
                 'Pursuing his ambitions, he manages to be introduced into '
                 'Parisian high society with the help of his influential '
                 'cousin, Mme. de Beauséant. Everything seems to be working '
                 'according to his plans, but for mentioning the name of '
                 'Goriot, he finds himself shut out of the Countess de '
                 "Restaud's salon, the meeting place of the cream of society. "
                 'Crestfallen over his first faux-pas, he learns from Mme. '
                 "Beauséant the secret of Père Goriot's life. The old man has "
                 'ruined himself and has accepted a miserable life in order '
                 'that his two daughters might be wealthy. Anastasie has '
                 'married a nobleman, Count de Restaud; Delphine an Alsatian '
                 'banker, Baron of Nucingen. Goriot, welcomed as long as his '
                 'fortune had lasted, found himself ostracized by his '
                 'sons-in-law when he became poor. Vautrin, who has sensed '
                 'ambition in Rastignac, cynically offers him a bargain: The '
                 'young student should win the love of the fair Victorine, '
                 'whose father is extremely rich but who has disowned her. As '
                 "the only obstacle to Victorine's inheriting the fortune is "
                 'her brother Frederic, Vautrin for the sum of 200,000 francs '
                 'would manage to get rid of young Taillefer, thus insuring '
                 "Victorine's and Rastignac's fortune. Rastignac is indignant, "
                 'but one feels that he is secretly tempted by the proposal. '
                 "After Rastignac's failure in high society, he will try, "
                 'aided by his cousin, to conquer the "middle world." He is '
                 'introduced to Mme. de Nucingen and, with the help of Goriot, '
                 'soon becomes her lover. In the meantime, Vautrin has started '
                 "his Machiavellian plan and has Victorine's brother murdered. "
                 'Everything seems to be in his favor when Mlle. Michonneau, a '
                 'spy for the police, discovers Vautrin to be an escaped '
                 'convict and has him arrested. This ends the detective story. '
                 "Goriot's daughters come to him for help. Their husbands have "
                 'discovered their affairs and are trying to ruin them. In a '
                 'pathetic scene, the two daughters show their monstrous '
                 'egoism and pride. Père Goriot is afflicted by a stroke. He '
                 'soon becomes delirious, muttering incoherent words, '
                 'revealing also his extreme love for the daughters who have '
                 'left him, one to go to a dance, the other to protect her '
                 'fortune. Goriot dies blessing his daughters, with only '
                 'Rastignac and Bianchon, a medical student, at his bedside. '
                 'Rastignac attends to the funeral arrangements and, after '
                 'saying a last goodbye to Goriot in the graveyard overlooking '
                 'Paris, declares war on the capital: "Beware, Paris, here I '
                 'come" and goes to Mme. de Nucingen\'s for dinner.',

 'summary_text': 'Jean Valjean, after spending nineteen years in jail and in '
                 'the galleys for stealing a loaf of bread and for several '
                 'attempts to escape, is finally released, but his past keeps '
                 'haunting him. At Digne, he is repeatedly refused shelter for '
                 'the night. Only the saintly bishop, Monseigneur Myriel, '
                 "welcomes him. Valjean repays his host's hospitality by "
                 'stealing his silverware. When the police bring him back, the '
                 'bishop protects his errant guest by pretending that the '
                 'silverware is a gift. With a pious lie, he convinces them '
                 'that the convict has promised to reform. After one more '
                 'theft, Jean Valjean does indeed repent. Under the name of M. '
                 'Madeleine he starts a factory and brings prosperity to the '
                 'town of Montreuil. Next, Hugo introduces the pathetic young '
                 'girl Fantine. Alone and burdened with an illegitimate child, '
                 'she is on the way back to her hometown of Montreuil, to find '
                 'a job. On the road, she entrusts her daughter to an '
                 'innkeeper and his wife, the Thénardiers. In Montreuil, '
                 "Fantine finds a job in Madeleine's factory and attains a "
                 'modicum of prosperity. Unfortunately she is fired and, at '
                 'the same time, must meet increasing financial demands by the '
                 'Thénardiers. Defeated by her difficulties, Fantine turns to '
                 'prostitution. Tormented by a local idler, she causes a '
                 'disturbance and is arrested by Inspector Javert. Only '
                 "Madeleine's forceful intervention keeps her out of jail. She "
                 'catches a fever, however, and her health deteriorates '
                 'dangerously. Death is imminent and M. Madeleine promises to '
                 'bring her daughter, Cosette, to her. Madeleine, however, is '
                 'faced with serious problems. A man has been arrested as Jean '
                 'Valjean and is about to be condemned for his crimes. After a '
                 'night of agonizing moral conflict, Madeleine decides to '
                 'confess his past. At Arras, the seat of the trial, he '
                 'dramatically exonerates the accused. A few days later, he is '
                 "arrested by Javert at Fantine's bedside. The shocking scene "
                 'kills the young woman. That same night Valjean escapes, but '
                 'he is quickly recaptured and sent to Toulon, a military '
                 'port. One day he saves a sailor about to fall from the '
                 'rigging. He plunges into the sea and manages to escape by '
                 'establishing the belief that he has drowned. He uses his '
                 'precarious freedom to go to Montfermeil, the location of the '
                 "Thénardiers' inn. After burying his money in the woods, he "
                 "frees Cosette from the Thénardiers' abominable guardianship "
                 'and takes her into the protective anonymity of Paris. In '
                 'Paris, he lives like a recluse in a dilapidated tenement, '
                 'the Gorbeau House, in an outlying district. In spite of his '
                 'precautions, however, Javert manages to track him down. '
                 'Valjean is forced to flee abruptly. After a hectic chase and '
                 'imminent capture, he finds a miraculous refuge in a convent. '
                 'With the cooperation of the gardener, Fauchelevent, a man '
                 'whose life he has saved in the past, Valjean persuades the '
                 'prioress to take him on as assistant gardener and to enroll '
                 'Cosette as a pupil. Valjean and Cosette spend several happy '
                 'years in the isolation of the convent. Hugo now turns to '
                 'another leading character, Marius. Marius is a '
                 'seventeen-year-old who lives with his grandfather, M. '
                 'Gillenormand, a relic of the Old Regime. In a nearby town, '
                 "Georges Pontmercy, Marius' father, a hero of the Napoleonic "
                 'wars, lives in retirement. M. Gillenormand, by threatening '
                 'to disinherit Marius, has forced Georges Pontmercy to '
                 'relinquish custody of his son. He has completed the '
                 'estrangement by communicating his aversion for Pontmercy to '
                 'Marius. Consequently, the young man reacts almost '
                 "impassively to his father's death. A fortuitous conversation "
                 "reveals to Marius the depths of his father's love for him, "
                 "and indignant at his grandfather's deception, he leaves "
                 'home. He takes refuge in the Latin Quarter and falls in with '
                 'a group of radical students, the Friends of the A.B.C. '
                 "Marius, who under his father's posthumous influence has just "
                 'switched his allegiance from the monarchy to Napoleon, falls '
                 'into a state of intellectual bewilderment. Material '
                 'difficulties increase his unhappiness. Finally he manages to '
                 'create a tolerable existence by finding a modest job, living '
                 'frugally, and withdrawing into his inner dreams. His peace '
                 'is shattered when he falls passionately in love with a '
                 'beautiful young girl in the Luxembourg Gardens. She is Jean '
                 "Valjean's ward, Cosette. Too timid for bold actions, he "
                 'courts her silently. A fatal indiscretion ruins his nascent '
                 'love affair. He quizzes the doorman where the girl lives and '
                 'a week later she moves without leaving an address. For a '
                 'long time Marius is unable to find a clue to his '
                 "sweetheart's whereabouts and is overcome by despair. "
                 'Coincidence puts him back on the track. One day curiosity '
                 'impels him to observe his neighbors through a hole in the '
                 'wall. He glimpses a family — father, mother, and two '
                 'daughters — living in unspeakable squalor. Soon after he '
                 'witnesses the entrance of a philanthropist, M. Leblanc, and '
                 'his daughter. To his immense surprise, the daughter is '
                 'Cosette. His jubilation is replaced by consternation when he '
                 'discovers that his neighbors are planning to draw M. Leblanc '
                 'into a trap the same evening. Marius contacts the police and '
                 'on the instructions of Inspector Javert returns to his room. '
                 "When Leblanc comes back, Marius' neighbor identifies himself "
                 'as Thénardier, ties up his victim, and demands an exorbitant '
                 'ransom. The plot fails with the timely arrival of the '
                 'inspector. In the confusion of the arrest, Leblanc escapes. '
                 "Once again, the young girl has vanished. But Thénardier's "
                 'daughter, who is selflessly in love with Marius, manages to '
                 'find his sweetheart for him. After worshiping Cosette from '
                 'afar, Marius summons the courage to declare his love. '
                 'Cosette reciprocates. For a whole month the couple lives a '
                 'chaste and secret idyll, secret because Cosette intuitively '
                 "guesses Valjean's hostility to the man who is usurping his "
                 "place. Marius' happiness is unwittingly shattered by "
                 'Valjean, who, disturbed by a secret warning and the growing '
                 'popular unrest in Paris, has decided to take Cosette to '
                 'England. As a first step he moves to a hideaway prepared for '
                 'this kind of emergency. Absorbed by his love, Marius has '
                 'been unaware of the deteriorating political situation. Now '
                 'his private crisis is echoed by the crisis of an imminent '
                 'insurrection. His friend Enjolras directs the erection of a '
                 'barricade in front of the Corinth wine shop. The first enemy '
                 "he has to deal with is found within the rebels' ranks. It is "
                 'Javert, who is unmasked as a spy and tied up to await '
                 'execution. Marius, driven by despair, decides to seek death '
                 'in the insurrection. He joins the fighters at the barricade '
                 'and fights valiantly to the end. Valjean also joins the '
                 'insurgents, but for special reasons. He has discovered '
                 "Marius' relationship with Cosette and his role in the "
                 "revolution. For Cosette's sake, he decides to protect the "
                 'life of the man he abhors. Before the final assault, Valjean '
                 'volunteers to execute Javert. Instead, he spares the '
                 "inspector's life and sends him away. Then Valjean returns to "
                 'the barricade as the few surviving defenders are driven '
                 'inside the wine shop. He seizes the seriously wounded '
                 'Marius, disappears into a manhole, and undertakes a heroic '
                 'and harrowing passage through the sewers of Paris. '
                 'Unfortunately, Javert arrests him at the exit. However, he '
                 'allows Valjean to take Marius to his grandfather and later, '
                 'in a quandary, releases Valjean. But he cannot forgive '
                 "himself for this breach of duty and commits suicide. Marius' "
                 'life has a happier ending. He recuperates from his wounds '
                 "and overcomes his grandfather's hostility to his marriage. "
                 'The marriage, however, is a mortal blow to Valjean. He has '
                 'confessed his past to Marius, and the latter, in spite of '
                 'his magnanimity, slowly estranges Cosette from Valjean. '
                 'Marius does not know that Valjean is the man who saved his '
                 "life in the sewers. Without Cosette, Valjean's life loses "
                 'its meaning and he slowly withers away. Thénardier, however, '
                 'unwittingly reveals to Marius that Valjean is his savior, '
                 'and Marius and Cosette arrive in time to console Jean '
                 'Valjean on his deathbed.',

                 'is part black and has killed a white woman than they are '
                 'about it being Joanna who was murdered. Flashback three '
                 'years earlier to the Jefferson planing mill where a man '
                 'named Byron Bunch works; Byron will become one of the main '
                 'characters — and a primary narrator — in the novel. A man '
                 'named Joe Christmas shows up looking for work and is hired, '
                 'followed soon thereafter by a man named Joe Brown being '
                 'hired. Christmas and Brown work together and form a '
                 'relationship about which the other workers are unsure. Brown '
                 'lets it be known that Christmas used to run a whiskey '
                 "distillery; it's unclear if Christmas still runs it. But the "
                 'talk is that Christmas still does, and that Brown delivers '
                 'the whiskey to whomever will buy it. Christmas quits the '
                 'planing mill; Brown quits soon thereafter. We learn that '
                 'Christmas — and perhaps Brown as well — supposedly lives in '
                 'an old slave quarter on the grounds of an old plantation '
                 "owned by Miss Joanna Burden. Burden's family had moved to "
                 'Jefferson from the north during Reconstruction; Burden '
                 'purportedly remains a Yankee — which in Jefferson means '
                 'befriending blacks. Byron Bunch is working alone at the '
                 'planing mill when Lena Grove shows up looking for Lucas '
                 'Burch. Byron and Lena strike up a conversation, during which '
                 "Byron lets slip that Joe Brown is an alias of Lucas Burch's. "
                 'Byron is disappointed because he has started to have '
                 'affections for Lena. The story recounts how Reverend Gail '
                 'Hightower and his wife came to Jefferson long ago when '
                 'Hightower was hired by a Jefferson Presbyterian church to be '
                 "its minister. Oftentimes Hightower's wife leaves Jefferson "
                 'supposedly to visit her family, but one day a woman from '
                 'Jefferson who is in Memphis shopping sees Mrs. Hightower, '
                 'and Jefferson soon begins gossiping about why Mrs. Hightower '
                 'regularly visits Memphis. Eventually she is '
                 'institutionalized, and once released returns to be with her '
                 'husband in Jefferson. However, she soon again regularly '
                 'visits Memphis and eventually dies after falling through a '
                 'hotel window; she was in the hotel with a man with whom she '
                 'had registered as husband and wife. The sensationalism of '
                 "Reverend Hightower's wife having been in a Memphis hotel "
                 'with another man turns Jefferson against Hightower, and '
                 'eventually he is forced to resign his position from the '
                 'church. The town tries to force him to leave Jefferson '
                 'altogether, but he refuses. The furor eventually dies down, '
                 'but Hightower is forever regarded as damned by the people of '
                 'Jefferson. Byron Bunch visits Hightower and narrates how the '
                 'Burden house has burned down. Miss Burden is dead from her '
                 'neck being cut, and it appears that the fire was set to '
                 'cover up the murder. Brown is questioned by the sheriff and '
                 'claims that Christmas and Miss Burden have been sleeping '
                 'with one another; even more shocking to the sheriff is '
                 "Brown's assertion that Christmas is part black. It's unclear "
                 'how truthful Brown is in relating the details concerning '
                 'Christmas, Miss Burden, and the fire. The story then flashes '
                 'back even farther when Joe Christmas was five years old and '
                 'living in an orphanage, and he inadvertently caught the '
                 'dietician and another orphanage employee having sex. Joe '
                 "thinks he's in trouble because he was eating a mouthful of "
                 "toothpaste in the dietician's room; the dietician thinks "
                 'that Joe will tell that he saw her and the man together. The '
                 'dietician contrives to get Joe sent to an orphanage for '
                 "black children rather than remaining at the white children's "
                 'orphanage. Eventually, a man named McEachern adopts Joe and '
                 'takes him home; McEachern is unaware that Joe is part black. '
                 'Time passes, and Joe eventually grows into a teenager. At '
                 'seventeen, he begins sneaking out of the McEachern house and '
                 'meeting a waitress named Bobbie from town. Their '
                 'relationship is sexual. Joe is more serious — and naïve — '
                 'about their relationship than Bobbie is. McEachern begins to '
                 'suspect that Joe is sneaking out of the house and one night '
                 'sees Joe go into the stable, where Joe keeps a suit to wear '
                 'when meeting Bobbie. A car picks up Joe, and McEachern '
                 'follows on his horse. McEachern discovers Joe and Bobbie at '
                 'a dance and begins yelling at Bobbie. Joe strikes McEachern '
                 'with a chair. Bobbie runs from the dance, and Joe runs home '
                 'to get the secret money that Mrs. McEachern has been hiding '
                 'from her husband but not from Joe. Joe goes to where Bobbie '
                 'lives, intending that he and Bobbie will run away together '
                 'and get married. But the couple with whom Bobbie lives over '
                 'the restaurant and a nameless man are preparing to leave '
                 'town with Bobbie; all of them fear that Joe has killed '
                 'McEachern and that the police will soon show up on their '
                 "doorstep. Joe doesn't truly understand what's happening. The "
                 'stranger repeatedly strikes Joe until Joe is close to losing '
                 'consciousness. Following his losing Bobbie, Joe runs away. '
                 'For fifteen years he wanders, traveling between Chicago, '
                 'Detroit, and Mexico, and finally heading into Mississippi. '
                 'He happens upon the Burden house and breaks in to steal '
                 "food. Joe is discovered by Miss Burden, who doesn't seem "
                 'upset that Joe has broken into her kitchen. In fact, Miss '
                 'Burden allows Joe to stay in an old slave cabin on her '
                 'property. One night he enters the Burden house unannounced, '
                 'goes to her bedroom, and has sex with her. But then, '
                 'troubled with himself, Joe avoids her until one day he finds '
                 'her in his cabin, where she tells Joe the story of herself '
                 "and her ancestors. Joe and Joanna's relationship goes "
                 "through various phases. At one point, Joanna says that she's "
                 'pregnant — although she is not. Toward the end of their '
                 'relationship, Joanna tries to get Joe to go to a school for '
                 'blacks and then become a lawyer, but Joe will not do these '
                 'things, in part because that would mean he would first have '
                 'to acknowledge that he is part black. The last phase of '
                 'their relationship involves Joanna trying to get Joe to pray '
                 'with her, but Joe refuses. Joanna suggests that perhaps both '
                 'she and Joe should kill themselves, and not too long '
                 'thereafter Joe kills Joanna. The sheriff hunts for Joe but '
                 'is unable to track him down. Byron Bunch speaks to Hightower '
                 'and reveals that he has taken Lena to live in the cabin that '
                 'Lucas Burch and Joe Christmas lived in on the Burden '
                 'plantation. Joe, continually avoiding capture by the '
                 'Jefferson sheriff, eventually hitches a ride going to '
                 'Mottstown, which is not too far from Jefferson. Joe is '
                 'caught in Mottstown without putting up a struggle. During '
                 "Joe's capture, Uncle Doc Hines is downtown and hears Joe's "
                 'name being said by the townspeople. He runs up to the crowd '
                 'holding Joe and begins yelling that Joe should be killed '
                 'immediately. Later, Mrs. Hines asks her husband what he did '
                 "with Milly's baby — meaning Joe Christmas; eventually we "
                 "learn that Joe Christmas is the Hines' grandson, born to "
                 'their daughter, Milly. The sheriff from Jefferson arrives in '
                 'Mottstown and takes custody of Joe. Uncle Doc and Mrs. Hines '
                 'buy two train tickets for Jefferson. Back in Jefferson, '
                 "Byron brings Doc and Mrs. Hines to Hightower's house, where "
                 "Doc and Mrs. Hines individually recount Joe's history: The "
                 "Hines' daughter, Milly, had sex with a black man from a "
                 'traveling circus and got pregnant. Hines killed the man, and '
                 'Milly eventually died giving birth to Joe. Hines took Joe '
                 "without Mrs. Hines' knowledge and deposited him on an "
                 "orphanage's doorstep. During the next five years, Hines "
                 'watched Joe grow; Mrs. Hines had no idea if Joe was even '
                 "alive. Once the Hines have finished relating Joe's history, "
                 'Byron asks Hightower if Hightower will lie and say that Joe '
                 'was with him when Joanna Burden was killed, thereby '
                 'providing Joe an alibi. Hightower adamantly refuses. Byron '
                 'gets Hightower to come to the cabin in which Lena is staying '
                 'because Lena is about to give birth. Doc and Mrs. Hines are '
                 'there as well. Hightower helps Lena gives birth to a boy, '
                 'and then returns home. Later, he again returns to the cabin '
                 'and finds Lena and her son alone. Lena explains that Byron '
                 'asked her to marry him and that she said no. Hightower '
                 'learns that Byron has quit his job at the planing mill and '
                 'is downtown at the courthouse. Bryon talks the sheriff into '
                 'taking Lucas Burch out to the cabin to show Lena and the '
                 'baby to him. Lucas is surprised to see Lena, as well as the '
                 'baby. He begins his usual deceitful banter about his wanting '
                 "to take care of Lena and their child, but he's waiting on "
                 "money and has enemies who don't want him to get it. He again "
                 'walks out on Lena, slipping through a back window of the '
                 "cabin so that the deputy sheriff waiting at the front won't "
                 'see him. Byron spies Lucas leaving the cabin and follows '
                 'him, eventually catching up to Lucas by the train tracks '
                 'that run outside of Jefferson. Byron fights Lucas and is '
                 'beaten — as he guessed he would be. Byron watches as Lucas '
                 'jumps onto a train and disappears. While Byron is walking '
                 'back to the cabin, a man in a passing wagon tells Byron that '
                 'Joe has been killed. We learn that as the deputy sheriff was '
                 'leading Joe through the town square, Joe escaped. A young '
                 'man named Percy Grimm, who had organized men to guard the '
                 'courthouse, jail, and square, followed Joe and eventually '
                 "saw Joe run into Hightower's house. Earlier, Joe's "
                 'grandmother, Mrs. Hines, had visited Joe in jail and told '
                 "Joe about Hightower. Over Hightower's assertion that Joe was "
                 'with him the night Joanna Burden was murdered, Grimm '
                 'repeatedly shoots Joe, and then castrates him with a butcher '
                 'knife. Joe dies. At the end of the novel, Lena is again on '
                 'the road, only this time she has Byron Bunch and her baby '
                 'with her. Bunch wants to marry Lena, but Lena seems consumed '
                 'with finding Lucas Burch — plus she likes traveling.',

{'author': 'Joseph Conrad',
 'book_title': 'Lord Jim',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'We are introduced to Jim (later, Lord Jim) at a time when he '
                 'was working as a water-clerk for a ship-chandler firm in the '
                 'Far East. It was menial work, but Jim seemed fairly happy, '
                 'and everyone liked him. They knew him simply as "Jim." Yet, '
                 "as the plot unfolds, with Conrad's skillful analysis of "
                 "Jim's character, we gradually realize that Jim was not "
                 '"merely" Jim; he was "one of us." Jim was born and raised in '
                 "an English parson's home, and when he was still a young lad, "
                 'he decided to make the sea his career; thus, he enrolled on '
                 'a training ship for officers of the merchant marine. He did '
                 'well and advanced to third place in navigation. While still '
                 'aboard the training ship, he met his first test of courage. '
                 'But during that test of courage, Jim held back in fear when '
                 'he was called upon to assist a vessel injured in a fierce '
                 'storm. Afterward, he justified himself and rationalized that '
                 'he was not really afraid; he was simply waiting for a '
                 'challenge that would be equal to his heroism. Next time, he '
                 'would be heroic. He was convinced that he would have another '
                 'chance. Sometime later, an injury from a falling spar put '
                 'Jim in the hospital, and after recovering, he shipped out as '
                 'first mate on the Patna , an old iron tramp steamer bound '
                 'for holy places with 800 Moslem religious pilgrims. The '
                 'other four officers of the Patna were riff-raff. '
                 'Accordingly, Jim held himself aloof from them. On a calm, '
                 'dark night in the Arabian Sea, the Patna ran over some '
                 'floating wreckage and got badly damaged in her forepeak '
                 'compartment. Jim discovered the damage and saw that the sea '
                 'was pressing in on the bulkhead, which walled in the hold, '
                 'where hundreds of the pilgrims were asleep. The bulkhead '
                 'bulged. It could not possibly withstand the pressure. Jim '
                 'was convinced that within minutes the sea would rush in and '
                 'the pilgrims would all be drowned. With too few lifeboats '
                 'and no time, there was no possible salvation for everybody '
                 'on board. Meanwhile, the skipper and the other officers '
                 'struggled to lower a lifeboat. Jim despised their cowardice '
                 'and refused to help them. Then he spotted a squall bearing '
                 'down on the Patna , and he knew that the lightest shudder '
                 'would burst the bulkhead. It might be a matter of seconds. '
                 'The officers got the boat over the side, while the squall '
                 'closed in with dark, tumbling clouds. The first gust of wind '
                 'hit the Patna , and she plunged. Jim was sure that it was '
                 'her last tremor. He jumped. Hours of horror followed. The '
                 "other officers resented Jim's presence in the lifeboat. They "
                 'watched as the lights of the Patna seemed to go out, and '
                 'meanwhile, Jim listened and seemed to hear the hysterical '
                 'screams of the helpless passengers. Once, he even considered '
                 'throwing himself over the lifeboat and swimming back. Before '
                 'sundown of the following day, the ship Avondale picked up '
                 'the four men, and ten days later, it delivered them to an '
                 "Eastern port. The story which the Patna 's skipper invented "
                 'as their alibi for desertion was immediately useless when '
                 'they heard the news that a French man-o-war had discovered '
                 'the Patna listing badly, deserted by her officers, and towed '
                 'it into Aden. At this news, the skipper vanished, and the '
                 'two engineers drank themselves into a hospital. Jim faced '
                 'the official inquiry panel alone. He defended himself '
                 "doggedly and insisted that there hadn't been a chance in a "
                 'million that the Patna could have survived. "There was not '
                 'the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and '
                 'wrong of this affair." At the inquiry, a man named Marlow '
                 'entered the scene, and throughout most of the novel, the '
                 "reader will see Jim through Marlow's sympathetic eyes and "
                 'emotions. Deeply interested in the young, wholesome-looking '
                 'Englishman who seemed so "doomed," Marlow attended the '
                 'inquiry and tried to discover why Jim deserted the Patna . '
                 'Then, a strange and dramatic circumstance brought Marlow and '
                 'Jim together. Jim confronted Marlow and accused him of '
                 'calling him a "wretched cur." Marlow convinced Jim that '
                 'another person had made the remark and was referring not to '
                 'Jim, but to an actual dog. Jim realized that he had exposed '
                 'his low opinion of himself to Marlow. Nevertheless, Marlow '
                 'found himself even more drawn to Jim, and so he invited the '
                 'young man to have dinner with him at Malabar House. There, '
                 'Jim related the story of what happened that night aboard the '
                 "Patna . Marlow was puzzled by the young man's attitude "
                 'toward himself, and, despite himself, he caught glimpses of '
                 'his own tormented soul within Jim. The inquiry ended, Jim '
                 'lost his naval certificate, and Marlow invited him to his '
                 'hotel room, where the reader sees the agony of the promising '
                 'young officer who now regarded himself as "no better than a '
                 'vagabond." Marlow found a job for Jim, and the young man did '
                 'well and pleased his employer. But suddenly, Jim '
                 'disappeared. Someone had mentioned the Patna affair and Jim '
                 'could not endure it. Under such circumstances, Jim left job '
                 'after job until every waterfront character throughout the '
                 "Orient knew Jim's story. Marlow finally confided Jim's story "
                 'to a Herr Stein, a philosophical old trader with a fabulous '
                 'butterfly collection. Stein, who had never seen Jim, labeled '
                 'him a "romantic" and suggested that Jim go to Patusan, an '
                 'isolated island community in a Malay state where three '
                 'warring factions were contending for supremacy. In Patusan, '
                 'Stein had an unprofitable trading post under the direction '
                 'of a slimy Portuguese, Cornelius. Jim could take over the '
                 'trading post and begin a new life; no one would know him in '
                 "Patusan. Stein's offer delighted Jim. He felt that he could "
                 'now bury his past completely and no one would ever find out '
                 'about it. Stein also gave Jim a silver ring, a symbol of '
                 'eternal friendship between Stein and Doramin, chief of the '
                 'Bugis Malays in Patusan. Alone, Jim traveled upriver to '
                 "Patusan, but he was soon captured by Rajah Allang's men. He "
                 'did, however, manage to leap over the stockade and escape to '
                 "Doramin's village, where he showed him Stein's silver ring, "
                 'symbolic of eternal friendship between Stein and Doramin. '
                 "Afterward, Jim was warmly welcomed and was protected. Jim's "
                 "hopes seemed about to be realized. Doramin's son, Dain "
                 "Waris, was a strong, intelligent youth about Jim's age, and "
                 'the two worked together to put down the vandalism of Sherif '
                 'Ali and to bring Rajah Allang under control. Jim felt secure '
                 'in the love and trust of all the Malays. He had a noble and '
                 'beloved friend in Dain Waris, and he fell in love with a '
                 'girl, Jewel, who shared his life. After two years, Marlow '
                 "visited Jim at Patusan, but it wasn't a completely "
                 'successful visit; Marlow felt that even his temporary '
                 'intrusion into this idyllic existence upset Jim and those '
                 'who were close to him. He resolved never again to visit '
                 "Patusan. The outside world also reentered Jim's sanctuary in "
                 'the person of "Gentleman Brown," a renegade Australian who '
                 'stole a ship and, with a band of desperate seamen, traveled '
                 'upriver to Patusan. He intended to plunder the settlement '
                 'and supply his ship for a voyage to Madagascar. When the '
                 'bandits arrived, Jim was away, but the village people under '
                 'Dain Waris repulsed the invaders and drove them to a knoll, '
                 'where the white men were able to throw up a temporary '
                 'defense. When Jim returned, Doramin, Dain Waris, and all of '
                 'the villagers urged immediate annihilation for the robbers, '
                 'but Jim decided to talk to Brown. Brown did not really know '
                 "anything about Jim's past, but he knew enough of his own "
                 "vile history, and so he judged Jim by himself; thus, Jim's "
                 'old fears and shame returned. Brown was able to see that Jim '
                 'had a guilty conscience about something. Jim did not want '
                 'bloodshed, so he promised Brown and his men safe conduct '
                 'down the river. Then he made a persuasive speech to the '
                 'Bugis in which he pledged his own life as security — should '
                 'any harm come to any of the villagers as a result of his '
                 "letting Brown's party go free. Brown, advised and guided by "
                 'the slimy Cornelius, left as planned, but he treacherously '
                 'ambushed a party of Malays under Dain Waris on the way '
                 "downriver. The chief's son and many of his soldiers were "
                 "killed. Survivors brought Dain Waris' body to his father, "
                 "Doramin. On the young man's hand was the silver ring which "
                 "Jim had sent to him as a pledge of Brown's good faith. "
                 'Someone took the ring and held it up for Doramin to see. The '
                 'old chief let out "one fierce cry, deep from the chest, a '
                 'cry of pain and fury." Meanwhile, the awful news reached '
                 'Jim. His new life had fallen into ruins. The Malays would '
                 'never again trust him. He had three choices. He could run; '
                 'he could fight (he had an arsenal); or he could give himself '
                 "up according to Malay custom. Jewel and Tamb' Itam, Jim's "
                 'servant, urged him to fight or, at least, flee, but Jim '
                 'deliberately crossed the creek and climbed the hill to '
                 "Doramin's village. Stooping down, he lifted the sheet from "
                 "Dain Waris' face. Then, alone and unarmed, he faced Doramin. "
                 'As the old chief rose up, the silver ring fell from his lap '
                 "and rolled to Jim's feet. Doramin shot Jim through the "
                 'chest, and as he did so, Lord Jim flashed a proud and '
                 'unflinching look toward all of the assembled Malays. Then he '
                 "fell at Doramin's feet, a hero in death.",

                 'Major Duncan Heyward, Psalmodist David Gamut, and Alice and '
                 'Cora Munro — strike through the wilderness forest for Fort '
                 'William Henry, which is besieged by the French near Lake '
                 'George. Led astray by Magua, they encounter the white '
                 'woodsman Hawkeye and his two Mohican companions, '
                 'Chingachgook and Uncas, whereupon the villainous Huron '
                 "escapes. Traveling to the safety of the caves at Glenn's "
                 'Falls, the party is attacked by Indians early the next '
                 'morning. Running out of munitions, the three woodsmen escape '
                 'downriver for help, but the others are captured and taken '
                 'away by a splinter group of warriors headed by Magua. After '
                 'a long journey, the Huron coldly proposes to Cora, whose '
                 'refusal brings an attack upon the captives, who are saved by '
                 'the sudden arrival of the three woodsmen. All the Indians '
                 'are killed except Magua, who gets away again. Leading the '
                 'party of protagonists through narrow escapes from Indians '
                 'and then besieging Frenchmen, Hawkeye brings them to a '
                 'mountainside vantage point overlooking the fort. During the '
                 'trip, a quiet interest develops between the young Uncas and '
                 'the brunette Cora, while Heyward shows a deference toward '
                 'Alice. With difficulty finding their way through the heavy '
                 'morning mists and the omnipresent French, the seven, hotly '
                 'pursued, finally reach the fort, where Commander Munro '
                 'recognizes the voice of his daughter Alice and opens a '
                 'sally-port for them. Heyward leads a repulse of the pursuing '
                 'Frenchmen. With the passage of days, a parley is held, and, '
                 'since General Webb is sending no help, Munro agrees to '
                 "surrender. Meanwhile, Heyward learns that Cora's darkened "
                 'aspect lies not only in a brooding nature but also in the '
                 'fact that she is part black. During the planned withdrawal '
                 'of the English forces, the Indians begin a bloody massacre, '
                 'and Magua once again escapes with the two girls and Gamut. '
                 'Three days later, the three woodsmen, Munro, and Heyward go '
                 'north of the lake and across the country in pursuit. When '
                 'Uncas is captured by the Hurons, Hawkeye effects his escape '
                 "and Alice's through disguise and all head for the Delaware "
                 'village where Cora is held captive. Magua follows and '
                 'demands his prisoners. Uncas reveals himself as a chief to '
                 'the patriarch Tamenund, and Magua is allowed his only '
                 'rightful prisoner, Cora, though the protagonists and the '
                 'Delawares vow to follow and regain her freedom. Coming out '
                 'of hiding in a beaver pond, Chingachgook and Munro join the '
                 'ensuing battle, in which the Hurons are defeated. '
                 'Nonetheless, Magua and two warriors escape with Cora through '
                 'the nearby caves and up a mountainside. Finally cornered by '
                 'Hawkeye, Heyward, Gamut, and Uncas, the Hurons give defiance '
                 'and in the fighting Cora, Uncas, and Magua are killed. The '
                 'next day is one of mourning for the Delawares. Cora and '
                 'Uncas are buried side by side, and all the white characters '
                 'except Hawkeye leave. When Chingachgook states that he is '
                 'now alone, Hawkeye grasps his hand and declares that such is '
                 'not so. At the same time, Tamenund sadly comments upon the '
                 'worsening historic plight of the American Indians and '
                 'particularly upon the tragically accomplished demise of the '
                 'wise and noble race of Mohicans.',

 'summary_text': 'When the eccentric hobbit Bilbo Baggins leaves his home in '
                 'the Shire, he gives his greatest treasure to his heir Frodo: '
                 'a magic ring that makes its wearer invisible. Because of the '
                 'difficulty Bilbo has in giving the ring away, his friend the '
                 'wizard Gandalf the Grey suspects that the ring is more than '
                 'it appears. Some years later, Gandalf reveals to Frodo that '
                 'the ring is in fact the One Ring, forged by Sauron the Dark '
                 'Lord thousands of years before to enable him to dominate and '
                 'enslave all of Middle-earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that the '
                 "Ring must be destroyed to defeat Sauron's evil, but he also "
                 "warns him that the Enemy has learned of the Ring's "
                 'whereabouts from the creature Gollum and will seek to find '
                 'it and kill its bearer. Despite the danger and hopelessness '
                 'of the quest, Frodo accepts the burden and resolves to take '
                 'the Ring to the safety of the elven stronghold of Rivendell. '
                 'Frodo sets off with three companions, fellow hobbits Merry, '
                 'Pippin, and Sam. After a series of close calls and '
                 'misadventures, where they are saved only by the timely '
                 'intervention of the mysterious Tom Bombadil, they reach the '
                 'town of Bree. The innkeeper delivers a letter from Gandalf '
                 'recommending a weather-beaten Ranger known as Strider as '
                 'their guide to the elves. Strider leads them cross-country, '
                 'hoping to avoid the Black Riders who are watching the Road, '
                 'but they are attacked near the ancient watchtower of '
                 'Weathertop. Frodo puts on the Ring, revealing himself to the '
                 'Black Riders. Their leader stabs him with a blade of evil '
                 'enchantment, and he nearly dies as they race for Rivendell. '
                 "The Nine Riders try to force Frodo's surrender, but a flood "
                 'destroys their horses even as Frodo collapses into '
                 'unconsciousness. Frodo wakes in Rivendell, where the wise '
                 'Elrond has worked his healing magic to save the hobbit. '
                 'Frodo discovers that Bilbo, now grown very old, lives with '
                 'the elves, and they reunite happily. Soon Elrond calls a '
                 'council of the representatives of elves, men, and dwarves to '
                 'respond to the growing darkness in the world. The council '
                 'reviews the history of the Ring from its forging to the '
                 "recent discovery that Frodo's ring is the One. Although "
                 'Boromir, the representative of Gondor, the greatest kingdom '
                 'of men, argues that the Ring should be used as a weapon '
                 'against the Enemy, the Council resolves to destroy it. '
                 'Someone must throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, '
                 "where it was first created, deep in Mordor, Sauron's "
                 'country. Frodo accepts the task of carrying the Ring to '
                 'Mordor, and a company is selected to help him on the quest: '
                 'the wizard Gandalf; the men Boromir and Aragorn (known to '
                 'Frodo as Strider but in fact the true king of Gondor); '
                 "Legolas the elf; Gimli the dwarf; and Frodo's own hobbit "
                 'kin, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. They are called the Fellowship '
                 'of the Ring. The company considers several paths through the '
                 'mountains, but the ways are all watched. Even if they did '
                 'not have Sauron to fear, Saruman the White, once the wisest '
                 'of the wizards, has allied himself with the Enemy and seeks '
                 'the Ring for himself. When they attempt to cross the pass of '
                 'Caradhras, an unnatural snowstorm nearly buries them, and '
                 'they are forced to turn back. Finally, they resolve to brave '
                 'the perilous dwarven Mines of Moria, now overrun by orcs and '
                 'even darker things. Within Moria, Gollum begins following '
                 'them. When the nine have nearly found their way out, they '
                 'are attacked by orcs and a Balrog, a terrible demon. Gandalf '
                 'holds it back so that the party can escape, but then he '
                 'falls with it into the abyss. Devastated by the loss of '
                 'Gandalf, the Fellowship flees to the elven wood of '
                 'Lothlórien. Lady Galadriel shelters them for a while and '
                 'offers wise counsel. Frodo offers the Ring to Galadriel, but '
                 'she resists the temptation. When the Fellowship leaves, she '

                 'Lysander argues that he is as good of a match as Demetrius, '

                 "won't marry Demetrius, she will die: This is the law of "
                 'Athens and his right as her father. Theseus agrees that '

                 "Theseus' wedding and is in the process of casting roles. "
                 'Nick Bottom, the weaver, is given the leading role of '
                 'Pyramus, while Francis Flute, the bellows-mender, wins the '

                 'assigned, and the group plans to meet the following night at '
                 "the Duke's oak for a rehearsal — the same woods where Hermia "
                 'and Lysander plan to meet on their flight from Athens. The '
                 'action of the play now shifts to this fairy-enchanted woods, '
                 "where Puck, Oberon's joker, speaks with one of Titania's "
                 'fairies. The fairy recognizes Puck as the troublemaker, '
                 'Robin Goodfellow. They also discuss the argument between '
                 'Titania and Oberon; Oberon is angry with Titania because she '
                 'refuses to give him the Indian boy she is raising. While '
                 'Puck and the fairy talk, Titania and Oberon enter from '
                 "opposite ends of the stage. After criticizing each other's "
                 'infidelities — Titania was supposedly in love with Theseus '
                 'and Oberon with Hippolyta, among others — Titania reminds '
                 'Oberon that their argument has led to chaos in the natural '
                 'world. Oberon says this disaster will end if she '
                 'relinquishes the Indian boy, but Titania refuses. Oberon '
                 'hatches a sneaky plan to get the boy back. He sends Puck out '
                 'to find a plant called love-in-idleness, the juice of which '
                 'makes any person dote on the next creature he or she sees. '
                 'While Puck is out looking for this magical flower, Demetrius '
                 'and Helena wander past Oberon. As usual, Demetrius insists '
                 'Helena stop following him; he even vows to harm her if she '
                 "doesn't leave him alone. Taking pity on Helena, Oberon "
                 "instructs Puck to put some love juice in Demetrius' eyes at "
                 'a moment when Helena will be the first person he sees upon '
                 'waking. Titania and her fairies are the next to enter the '
                 'stage, with Oberon secretly following. When Titania falls '
                 'asleep, Oberon squeezes the love juice in her eyes, hoping a '
                 'wild beast will be the first creature she sees upon waking. '
                 "In the meantime, Hermia and Lysander wander near Titania's "
                 'bower. Lost in the woods, they decide to stop and rest until '
                 'morning. Puck sees Lysander asleep and assumes he is the '
                 'nasty Athenian Oberon told him about. He puts the love juice '
                 "in Lysander's eyes. Still in pursuit of Demetrius, Helena "
                 'wanders past and notices the sleeping Lysander. She awakens '
                 'him, and he immediately falls in love with her. Cautious and '
                 'heartbroken, Helena assumes Lysander is teasing her, so she '
                 'runs away. Lysander follows. Hermia awakens, calling out for '
                 "Lysander's help, because she has just had a nightmare in "
                 'which a snake ate her heart. She dashes into the woods in '
                 'search of Lysander. Quince, Bottom, and the other actors are '
                 "the next characters to meander near Titania's bower. As they "
                 'rehearse "Pyramus and Thisbe," Puck secretly listens, '
                 'appalled by their awful acting. Deciding Bottom is the worst '
                 'in the bunch, Puck gives him an ass-head. When Bottom '
                 'saunters out of the woods to deliver his lines, the other '
                 'actors fly from him in fear. Bottom is unaware of the '
                 'transformation and walks unworriedly through the woods. '
                 'Singing as he passes her bower, Bottom awakens Titania who '
                 'immediately falls in love with him. Puck explains all of '
                 'these events to Oberon, who is pleased with the way his plan '
                 'has turned out. Indeed, everything seems perfect, until '
                 'Demetrius and Hermia walk past, Hermia believing Demetrius '
                 'has harmed Lysander, who has mysteriously disappeared. '
                 'Oberon realizes that Puck has anointed the wrong Athenian '
                 'with the love juice. Angry with this mistake, Oberon sends '
                 "Puck in search of Helena, vowing to charm Demetrius' eyes "
                 'when she appears. Now both Lysander and Demetrius are in '
                 "love with Helena, adding much to Puck's amusement at the "
                 'foolishness of mortals. Helena still believes they are '
                 'teasing her. When Hermia honestly, and confusedly, says she '
                 "knows nothing about the sudden switch in Lysander's "
                 'feelings, Helena believes she is simply playing dumb: In her '
                 'opinion, her three friends are laughing at her. Before a '
                 'serious fight breaks out between Demetrius and Lysander, '
                 'Oberon has Puck create a fog that will keep the lovers from '
                 "finding one another. While they're sleeping, Puck reverses "
                 'the spell on Lysander. He also casts a spell so none of the '
                 'lovers will remember what has happened in the woods. In the '
                 "meantime, Oberon returns to Titania's bower in search of the "
                 'Indian boy. Titania willingly releases him because she only '
                 "has eyes for Bottom. Oberon's plan is now complete, and he "
                 'is disgusted to see his queen in love with an ass, so he '
                 'releases her from the spell. Titania awakens and tells '
                 'Oberon about her strange dream of being in love with an ass. '
                 'Oberon has Puck remove the ass-head from Bottom. Now that '
                 'Oberon has won the Indian boy from Titania, he is willing to '
                 'forget their argument, and the two, reunited, dance off '
                 "together so they can bless Theseus' marriage. Morning has "
                 'arrived and Theseus, Hippolyta, and Egeus are walking '
                 'through the woods. Theseus suddenly spies the sleeping '
                 'lovers and imagines they woke early to observe the rite of '
                 'May. When the lovers are awakened, Demetrius confesses that '
                 'he now loves Helena. Theseus decides the other lovers should '
                 'be married along with him and Hippolyta. As they return to '
                 'the palace, the scene shifts to Bottom. Just awakening from '
                 "his dream, Bottom declares he'll have Quince write a ballad "
                 'about it, called "Bottom\'s Dream," because it has no '
                 "bottom. Quince and the other actors haven't forgotten their "
                 'missing friend, Bottom. They worry "Pyramus and Thisbe" '
                 "won't be able to go on without him, which saddens them "
                 'because Theseus is known for his generosity, and they might '
                 'have been rewarded with a lifelong pension for their '
                 'performance. As they lament this lost opportunity, Bottom '
                 'suddenly returns. His friends want to hear his story, but '
                 "Bottom tells them there isn't time for that: They must "
                 'prepare for the play. In the final scene, the play has come '
                 'full circle, and all of the cast returns to the palace where '
                 'Theseus and Hippolyta discuss the strange tale the lovers '
                 'have told them about the events of the previous evening. The '
                 'joyous lovers enter, and Theseus decides it is time to plan '
                 'the festivities for the evening. Of all the possible '
                 'performances, the play "Pyramus and Thisbe" turns out to be '
                 'the most promising. Theseus is intrigued by the paradoxical '
                 'summary of the play, which suggests it is both merry and '
                 'tragical, tedious and brief. The players finally present '
                 'their play. Hippolyta is disgusted by their pathetic acting, '
                 'but Theseus argues that even the best actors create only a '
                 'brief illusion; the worst must be assisted by an imaginative '
                 "audience. The play ends with Puck's final speech, in which "

 'summary_text': 'Charles Bovary, the only son of a middle-class family, '
                 'became a doctor and set up his practice in a rural village. '
                 'He made a marriage of convenience with a woman older than '
                 "himself. Upon his wife's death, Bovary married an attractive "
                 'young woman named Emma Roualt, the daughter of one of his '
                 'patients. For a while Emma was excited and pleased by her '
                 'marriage, but because of her superficial romantic ideals she '
                 'was soon bored and disillusioned by her new life. As a '
                 'result of her dissatisfaction she became ill. For the sake '
                 'of her health the Bovarys moved to a new town, where their '
                 "daughter was born. Emma's unhappiness continued, and she "
                 'began to have romantic yearnings toward Leon, a young law '
                 'clerk. After Leon left the town in order to attend law '
                 "school, Emma's boredom and frustration became more intense. "
                 'She was negligent of her duties as a wife and mother. None '
                 "of Bovary's efforts to please her were successful, and she "
                 'did not value or understand his devoted love for her. '
                 'Finally Emma had an adulterous affair with Rodolphe, a local '
                 'landowner. When he abandoned her, she became seriously ill. '
                 'After her recovery Emma encountered Leon in Rouen and began '
                 'to carry on an affair with him. In order to afford weekly '
                 'trips to the city to see Leon and to satisfy her other '
                 "whims, Emma spent her husband's money freely and incurred "
                 'many debts. She kept these secret from Bovary and managed to '
                 'obtain a Power of Attorney so that she would have full '
                 'control over their financial affairs. Eventually her unpaid '
                 'bills went long overdue and a judgment was obtained against '
                 'her by her creditors. She owed a vast sum of money, and the '
                 "sheriff's officers arrived to confiscate the family "
                 'property. Emma tried frantically to raise the money and '
                 'finally turned to both Rodolphe and Leon, but neither was '
                 'willing or able to help. Out of shame and despair, she '
                 'poisoned herself. Shortly afterwards her husband, now a '
                 'ruined and broken man, also died, leaving their daughter to '
                 'a life of poverty.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Lady Britomart has summoned her twenty-four-year-old son, '
                 "Stephen, into the drawing room to discuss the family's "
                 "finances for the first time in Stephen's life. It seems that "
                 'both of his sisters are about to be married and both young '
                 'women need extra money. While the younger, Sarah, is '
                 "marrying into money, her fiancé, Charles Lomax, won't come "
                 'into his millions until he is thirty-five years old. '
                 'Barbara, the older sister, has abandoned all social '
                 'pretension and has entered into a life of service in the '
                 'Salvation Army, where she holds the rank of Major. Major '
                 'Barbara has also attracted the attentions of a professor of '
                 'Greek who has joined the Salvation Army in order to be near '
                 'Major Barbara; unfortunately, he is "poor as a church '
                 'mouse." Furthermore, it is time that Stephen think of '
                 'marrying. Consequently, Lady Britomart has summoned her '
                 'former husband, the immensely wealthy Andrew Undershaft, to '
                 'come that evening to meet his family with the idea of '
                 'obtaining additional monies from him for each of the '
                 'children. Lady Britomart then sends for her daughters and '
                 'their fiancés, Charles Lomax and Professor Adolphus Cusins. '
                 'When the daughters hear that their father is due to arrive '
                 'at any minute, there is some alarm until Major Barbara '
                 'announces that even her father has a soul and that his soul '
                 'needs to be saved! When Undershaft is announced, he is '
                 'confused about the identities of everyone present until '
                 'Cusins takes charge of matters and straightens things out. '
                 'Undershaft then shows an immediate interest in Major '
                 "Barbara's work for the Salvation Army, and he maintains that "
                 'there are many similarities between the Salvation Army and '
                 'his own munitions factory. After a lengthy discussion about '
                 'the morals of both organizations, Major Barbara and her '
                 "father make a bargain to visit each other's places; "
                 'tomorrow, he will come to her shelter, and she, in turn, '
                 'will visit his munitions factory. To settle the agreement, '
                 'the family, along with the fiancés, decides to sing the '
                 'rousing, militant Salvation Army tune "Onward Christian '
                 'Soldiers." The next day at the Salvation Army Shelter, two '
                 'frequenters of the shelter are talking: Rummy Mitchens '
                 'reveals to Snobby Price that she, Rummy, is merely '
                 'pretending to be a worse sinner than she is because "the '
                 'lasses" at the shelter like it better. Snobby then reveals '
                 'that his act is also fraudulent, composed only of "made up '
                 'stories." At this moment, young Jenny Hill, eighteen years '
                 'old, arrives with Peter Shirley, a middle-aged man who '
                 'desires to work but who cannot find a job. Suddenly, a tough '
                 'young man named Bill Walker bursts into the shelter '
                 'demanding the whereabouts of his girlfriend and accuses the '
                 'Salvation Army of separating them. Then, without warning, '
                 'Bill strikes Jenny in the jaw. Peter and Rummy try to '
                 'separate the two, Snobby cowers cowardly in front of the '
                 'bully, Rummy is knocked down, but Shirley stands his ground, '
                 'and he challenges Walker to fight Todger Fairmile, a '
                 'wrestler and a new convert to the Salvation Army. At this '
                 "point, Major Barbara arrives and takes down Shirley's name; "
                 'when she approaches Walker, however, he refuses to give her '
                 'his name. Thus, she writes that he is the "man who struck '
                 'Jenny Hill." After further conversation with Walker, and '
                 'just as Major Barbara is on the verge of discovering that '
                 'this ruffian also has a conscience, Cusins arrives with '
                 'Andrew Undershaft, and Barbara tells Cusins to explain to '
                 'her father how the shelter functions; then she goes into the '
                 'shelter to attend to business. In a discussion about the '
                 'nature of religion and various virtues of truth, honor, and '
                 "justice as contrasted with Undershaft's money and power, "
                 'Cusins maintains that Undershaft will have to choose between '
                 "Barbara's views and Undershaft's own unique views. Cusins' "
                 'frankness and his understanding of religion appeal to '
                 "Undershaft, as does Undershaft's ironic and paradoxical "
                 'sense of life appeal to Cusins. When Cusins points out Major '
                 "Barbara's devotion to the common person, Undershaft, who was "
                 'born and grew up in poverty, points out that a love of '
                 'poverty (and thus dirt, disease, and suffering) is '
                 'unnatural. He asserts that he, Cusins, and Barbara are '
                 '"above" the common people, and therefore they have an '
                 'obligation to work together to elevate the common people. To '
                 'do so and since he cannot "buy" Barbara, he must buy the '
                 'Salvation Army. Suddenly, at this moment, the members of the '
                 'shelter return from one of their fund raising meetings. '
                 'After the money is counted, and the sum is discovered to be '
                 'short a few pence, Undershaft offers to make up the '
                 'difference, but Major Barbara refuses, telling her father '
                 'that he cannot "buy" his salvation. Bill Walker then returns '
                 'after an encounter with Todger Fairmile, and he says that he '
                 'wants to make a contribution as amends for hurting Jenny '
                 'Hill, but again, Major Barbara asserts that the Salvation '
                 'Army cannot be bought. At this point, Mrs. Baines, a '
                 'Salvation Army commissioner, arrives and meets Undershaft. '
                 'She enthusiastically describes the work of the Salvation '
                 'Army (explaining that the Army feeds the poor enough so that '
                 "they won't strike against the capitalists), and she "
                 'ecstatically tells about an offer made to the Army by a man '
                 "named Bodger, England's chief manufacturer of gin and beer. "
                 'Bodger, she says, has offered 5,000 pounds to the Army if a '
                 'donor, or donors, can be found to match this sum of money. '
                 'Undershaft gladly writes out a check for this sum to the '
                 'utter horror of Barbara and to the cynical amazement of Bill '
                 'Walker, who asks Barbara, "What price salvation now?" When '
                 'Major Barbara protests that the Army cannot accept '
                 'questionable or "tainted" money, she is barraged with a '
                 'series of seductive arguments in favor of accepting the '
                 'money. Cusins begins preparing for a parade to announce that '
                 'the shelters will remain open, and Major Barbara quietly '
                 'removes her badge of office and pins it on her father. As '
                 'most of the others march out, Bill Walker becomes angered '
                 'that the money which Barbara refused to take from him has '
                 'now been stolen by Snobby Price. When Major Barbara offers '
                 'to refund him his money, he in turn tells her that he will '
                 'not be "bought." After Bill leaves, Peter Shirley and '
                 'Barbara leave, consoling one another. The next day, in Lady '
                 "Britomart's drawing room, Cusins enters in a drunken state "
                 "announcing that the Salvation Army's rally was a great "
                 'success and that afterward he spent the night drinking '
                 'Spanish burgundy with Undershaft. Shortly afterward, '
                 'Undershaft arrives to settle money matters with Lady '
                 'Britomart. He readily concedes to the demands which she '
                 'makes for Barbara and Sarah, but he is adamant in his '
                 'intention to leave the remainder of his fortune to a '
                 'foundling, keeping the tradition of the Undershaft Munitions '
                 '— that it, the factory must always be left to a foundling. '
                 'Undershaft, however, does agree to help Stephen get started '
                 'in a good job, and after a lengthy discussion with Lady '
                 'Britomart, they decide that Stephen would be a good '
                 'journalist because he knows how to use words that have no '
                 'meaning. When the others return, Undershaft reminds Barbara '
                 'that it is now time for her to keep her part of the bargain '
                 'and visit the munitions factory. As they all leave, Barbara '
                 'braces herself to see an eternal pit of fire and damnation — '
                 'in short, a "factory of death." Upon arriving at the '
                 'munitions village, the Undershafts and fiancés are '
                 'astonished to find that it is a model of absolute perfection '
                 '— it is marred only by the fact that everyone lives there '
                 'with the knowledge that they might "be blown to smithereens '
                 'at any moment." In a discussion of the Undershaft tradition '
                 'of having a foundling inherit the entire fortune and the '
                 'factory, Cusins reveals that through a technicality (his '
                 "mother — Cusins' mother — was his father's dead wife's "
                 'sister, which makes Cusins illegitimate in England even '
                 'though he was considered legitimate in Australia, where he '
                 'was born), he is legally a foundling — but he does not know, '
                 'really, if he wants the job or the inheritance. Cusins has '
                 'no qualms about changing his name, but he is totally opposed '
                 'to war and destruction. Undershaft then argues that cannons '
                 'do not kill people — it is the persons who fire the cannons '
                 'who kill others. He challenges Cusins to take the job and '
                 'then use his money and power to change human nature — to '
                 'create people of honesty and courage and moral conviction. '
                 'Undershaft then leaves Cusins and Barbara together, and they '
                 'both agree that they could use the munitions factory for the '
                 'benefit of humanity and, furthermore, that Barbara, instead '
                 'of converting people by promising them food and shelter, '
                 'would now be able to convert people who are in no dire need '
                 'of physical comforts. Thus, once again, after leaving the '
                 'Salvation Army, Barbara "returns to her colors."',

 'summary_text': 'In writing Main Street, Sinclair Lewis paid little attention '
                 'to formal plot development. Consequently the narrative '
                 'presents a series of episodes rather than a tightly '
                 'constructed plot. Carol Milford Kennicott, a graduate of '
                 '"sanctimonious" Blodgett College, with a year of additional '
                 'study in a Chicago library school, works as a librarian in '
                 'St. Paul (Minnesota) for three years before her marriage to '
                 'Dr. Will Kennicott, of Gopher Prairie. She is a rebel '
                 'against ugliness and conformity, and one factor in her '
                 'decision to accept Kennicott is the opportunity to make over '
                 'a planless middle west prairie town. The story proper begins '
                 'when, after a honeymoon in the Colorado mountains, the '
                 'Kennicotts approach Gopher Prairie on the train. In the drab '
                 'town are three thousand dull people, in a social strata '
                 'ranging from Swede farmer to bank president. Main Street has '
                 'two-story brick shops flanked by Fords and lumber wagons. '
                 'There is no park to rest the eyes. The Kennicott family home '
                 'is outdated and stuffy. The prairie, vast and empty, '
                 'stretches away on every side. Dreams end and realism begins '
                 'when Carol takes a thirty-minute walk, inspecting the town, '
                 'north and south, east and west. It is then that she realizes '
                 'the shabbiness surrounding her. Her first social evening is '
                 'also a disappointment, for she finds the conversation of '
                 'both men and women personal and trivial. She tries to '
                 'introduce something different. On the way home, however, she '
                 'is lectured by her husband on the danger of shocking people. '
                 'As time goes on, Carol makes one attempt after another to '
                 'enlist the help of others in uplifting Gopher Prairie. An '
                 'early project is the formation of a dramatic club, which '
                 'functions just long enough to present one mediocre '
                 'production, The Girl from Kankakee. Carol becomes a member '
                 'of the Jolly Seventeen, a bridge club composed of an elite '
                 'group of young married women. She also joins the Thanatopsis '
                 'Club, a literary organization, and tries to change the club '
                 'programs, which are stilted and superficial. Her suggestions '
                 'make little headway. Her appointment to the library board '
                 'gives her a chance to express her opinions about books and '
                 'reading, but her ideas are not welcomed by the local '
                 'librarian, whose policy is to keep books clean by '
                 "discouraging readers. After the Kennicotts' child, Hugh, is "
                 'born, Carol feels that her motherhood hems her in more than '
                 'ever. The Smails, relatives of Dr. Kennicott, come to live '
                 'in Gopher Prairie and are a constant irritant because of '
                 'their critical attitude toward Carol and their interference '
                 'with her household affairs. Parallel with the story of the '
                 'Kennicotts is that of Bea Sorenson, who becomes the wife of '
                 'Miles Bjornstam, a free-thinking Swede. Their wedded life '
                 'ends in tragedy, for Bea and her child, Olaf, both die of a '
                 'fever. The townspeople blame Miles for their deaths. Still '
                 "cynical, he leaves Gopher Prairie for Canada. Carol's "
                 'closest woman friend is Vida Sherwin, a high-school teacher, '
                 'who later marries Raymond Wutherspoon. Vida is as domestic '
                 'and conservative as Carol is nonconformist. Raymond, largely '
                 "because of Vida's influence, blossoms out after marriage. He "
                 'returns from the army to become manager of the Bon Ton, the '
                 'highest-class store in town. Carol is attracted to Guy '
                 'Pollock, a lawyer who has ideas similar to hers, though he '
                 'has waited so long to express them that he is now a victim '
                 'of "Village Virus." Fearing that the same fate may be hers, '
                 'Carol attempts one improvement project after another, all of '
                 "them ending in failure. Percy Bresnahan, Gopher Prairie's "
                 'multimillionaire native son, comes home for a visit and '
                 'makes advances to Carol. She repels him with disgust. The '
                 'only serious extra-marital love affair in Main Street is '
                 "that between Carol and Erik Valborg, a tailor's assistant "
                 'five years younger than she. Dr. Kennicott puts a stop to '
                 'the romance and makes plain to his wife the kind of life she '
                 'would lead if married to the son of a Swedish farmer. Erik '
                 'abruptly leaves Gopher Prairie on the Minneapolis train. '
                 'Still another episode is that introducing Fern Mullins, a '
                 'young high-school teacher, who becomes involved with a '
                 'pupil, Cy Bogart, at a barn dance. She is the center of a '
                 'storm of disapproval and intolerance. Like Bjornstam and '
                 'Valborg before her, Fern leaves town on the train. Finally '
                 'Carol takes the train herself. She leaves Kennicott and '
                 'spends almost two years working in Washington during World '
                 'War I. She enjoys the cultural opportunities of the city but '
                 'is willing after a time to return to her husband and Gopher '
                 'Prairie. Their second child, a daughter, is born. Carol '
                 'realizes that she has raged at individuals when institutions '
                 'are really to blame and that although she is beaten, she has '
                 'kept the faith. She predicts changes yet undreamed of if the '
                 "baby lives out a normal lifetime. Dr. Kennicott's final "
                 'remarks reveal that he is more concerned about the immediate '
                 'present than the remote future. The reader realizes that the '
                 'gap between wife and husband is still wide and that the '
                 'novel really ends in an impasse.',

                 "first adamant, but finding himself tempted by Isabella's "
                 'beauty, and by her very purity, he offers to pardon Claudio '

                 'of the action. Having reassured Claudio by bringing him to a '
                 'sense of peace in death, he presents Isabella with a plan '

                 "follows the formal, romantic relationship between Leonato's "
                 'daughter, Hero (a young woman), and Claudio (a young '

                 'he is deeply in love with Hero and wants to ask her father '
                 'for permission to marry her. His commander, Don Pedro, helps '

                 'childhood friend, Jim Burden, share words about the past. '
                 'Their conversation is a reminiscence about their small '

                 'will be a personal story. With this introduction, Ántonia '
                 "Shimerda's story begins and is marked by the changes in the "
                 'seasons of both life and the prairie. The reader travels '

                 'Virginia relatives send the 10-year-old Jim to his '
                 'grandparents, who live on a Nebraska farm. During his train '
                 'trip, Jim learns of an immigrant family that is also '
                 'traveling to Black Hawk. When they reach their destination, '
                 'Otto Fuchs, a cowboy, picks up Jim and Jake Marpole, a hired '
                 'hand who has accompanied Jim; leaving the station, Jim sees '
                 'the immigrant family, looking huddled and lost. Jim meets '

                 'appreciating a whole new world of earth, sun, and unending '

                 'take provisions to their new neighbors, the immigrant '
                 'Shimerda family, and find that they are living in a lean-to '
                 'that fronts a cave. Jim plays with Yulka and Ántonia and '
                 'agrees to help Ántonia learn English. He also takes his '
                 'first long pony ride in the autumn colors of Nebraska. But, '

                 "Peter, two Russians whom Ántonia's father has befriended. On "
                 'the way home Jim gives Ántonia a reading lesson on a bank '
                 'near a badger hole. Ántonia explains that in Bohemia the '
                 'badger is revered; they also rescue a frail green insect, '
                 'reminding Ántonia of stories from "home." They meet Mr. '
                 'Shimerda who has killed three rabbits, and he says he will '
                 'make Ántonia a hat and someday give Jim his gun, a prized '
                 'possession from Bohemia. His sad smile is a poignant '
                 'foreshadowing of the future. Ántonia is feeling superior to '
                 'Jim because she is four years older, but one day when he '
                 'kills a huge rattlesnake Ántonia tells everyone of their '
                 "adventure and brags about Jim's role. Now they seem to be "
                 'more equal. This is only the beginning of their shared '
                 'memories. In the fall, the Russians get into trouble with '
                 "Wick Cutter, Black Hawk's moneylender, and must pay a huge "

                 'days later Pavel dies and Peter sells everything and goes '
                 'away to cook at a construction camp. Their sad story '

                 'gets sick and has to stay in with what today is called '
                 'tonsillitis . These weeks are filled with family '
                 'togetherness, popcorn, taffy, and storytelling. Jake tells '
                 'Grandmother that the Shimerdas are hungry and living in '
                 "wretched conditions, so they take Ántonia's family a big "
                 'hamper of food. A few days later there is a tremendous '
                 'snowstorm and the Burdens are forced to have "a country '
                 'Christmas" and stay in with gingerbread cookies and homemade '
                 'presents. They also send gifts to the Shimerdas. There are '
                 'prayers and the reading of the Christmas Story from the '
                 'gospels, culminating with an afternoon visit from Mr. '
                 'Shimerda. He thanks the Burdens for their kindness and '
                 'relaxes in the warm, family atmosphere. He crosses himself '
                 'to pray and, though Jim is afraid his grandfather might be '
                 'angry because he is conservative in religious matters, '
                 'Grandfather says that the prayers of all good people are '
                 'good. Following Christmas the weather is better and Mrs. '
                 'Shimerda and Ántonia visit the Burdens. Unlike her humble '
                 'and grateful husband, Mrs. Shimerda complains that while her '
                 'family struggles, the Burdens live in luxury, causing '
                 'Grandmother Burden to give her a cooking pot. Meanwhile, '
                 'Ántonia tells Jim that her father only came to America '
                 'because her mother wanted Ambrosch to become rich. In '
                 "January, on Jim's eleventh birthday, a blizzard buries the "
                 'prairie. It is during this time that the despondent Mr. '
                 'Shimerda commits suicide, putting the barrel of a gun to his '
                 'mouth and pulling the trigger. While arrangements are made '
                 'about the body, Jim feels sad for the sensitive man and is '
                 "hoping that Mr. Shimerda's soul is resting before its long "
                 'journey back to Bohemia. The next day Otto returns from '
                 'Black Hawk with Anton Jelinek, a young Bohemian farmer, who '
                 'has come to help his fellow immigrants. The coroner and '
                 'priest arrive and a coffin is fashioned but Mr. Shimerda is '
                 'denied burial in the Catholic or Norwegian cemetery. Mrs. '
                 'Shimerda insists that he be buried at the corner of their '
                 'land where future roads will eventually cross. They inter '
                 'Mr. Shimerda and years later his grave is a little island '
                 'with roads curving around it. Jim loves the quiet grave, and '
                 'in the distant future it is here where he meets and talks '
                 'with Ántonia. In the spring, the Shimerdas are living in a '
                 'new house their neighbors help build and Ántonia is working '
                 'in the fields like a farm hand. Jim notices that she has '
                 'become manly and coarse, Mrs. Shimerda remains suspicious '
                 'and ungrateful, and Ambrosch is deceitful and sly. There is '
                 'a rift between the two families over a horse collar but it '
                 'is later healed by Grandfather. When Jim has been with his '
                 'grandparents three years, they decide to move into Black '
                 'Hawk. Here Jim longs for the prairie and misses his '
                 'friendship with Ántonia and the farmhands. His grandmother '
                 'arranges for a neighbor, Mrs. Harling, to engage Ántonia as '
                 "her hired girl. This marks the beginning of Ántonia's "
                 'experiences in town. She works well for the Harlings, but '
                 'she is also drawn to a dance pavilion with a group of other '
                 'hired girls. Among them are Lena Lingard, a dressmaker, and '
                 "Tiny Soderball, who works at the Boys' Home Hotel. Lena has "
                 'a dubious reputation and is flirtatious and beautiful. As '
                 'Jim continues to spend time with Ántonia, by summer her '
                 'social life is interfering with her job and she is fired. So '
                 'she goes to work for Wick Cutter, the notorious moneylender '
                 'and womanizer. By now a bored Jim is sneaking out at night '
                 'to dances and seeing Lena who has let him kiss her. He '
                 'begins to dream sensuous dreams of her but wishes his dream '
                 'girl were Ántonia. When his grandmother discovers he is '
                 'sneaking out, Jim is contrite and promises not to do it '
                 'anymore. A summer picnic is an opportunity for one last '
                 'idyllic day spent with Ántonia and Lena where Ántonia scolds '
                 'him for flirting with Lena, telling him he has a greater '
                 'future than life in Black Hawk. The day ends with a symbolic '
                 'image of a plow, bold and black against the setting sun. '
                 'Meanwhile, Ántonia is suspicious of a trip planned by Wick '
                 'Cutter and her misgivings prove to be correct. She convinces '
                 "Jim to spend the night at the Cutters' house and Wick "
                 'returns in an attempt to seduce Ántonia. She leaves the '
                 'Cutter employ and once again is engaged by the Harlings. Jim '
                 'spends the summer studying for exams to get into the state '
                 'university. In the fall, he leaves for Lincoln and the '
                 'university, but no matter how much he studies he finds his '
                 'life on the prairie and his friendships interfering with his '
                 'concentration. Lena moves to Lincoln, and she and Jim begin '
                 'a social life that includes attending plays together, most '
                 "notably Dumas' Camille . This leads Jim to neglect his "
                 'studies and his Latin teacher, Gaston Cleric, suggests that '
                 'Jim transfer to Harvard University where Cleric is taking a '
                 'position. Jim is now nineteen and his grandfather permits '
                 'him to go to the East. Before he leaves, Lena tells him that '
                 'Ántonia is engaged to a railroad man, Larry Donavan. The '
                 'friends go their separate ways. Jim leaves for Harvard and '
                 'Ántonia goes to Denver to marry Larry Donovan. Lena opens a '
                 'dressmaking shop in San Francisco and Tiny Soderball '
                 'eventually ends up in Alaska where she becomes wealthy. Jim '
                 'assumes that Ántonia is fine, but he later finds out Donovan '
                 'deceived her, leaving her pregnant and unmarried. Ántonia '
                 'returns to Black Hawk, has her baby, and works in the fields '
                 'once again. On a return visit Jim spends a day with Ántonia '
                 'and she shows him her baby. She seems somber but settled and '
                 'Jim tells her how much she has become a part of him. He '
                 'holds also the memories of her father who lives on in both '
                 'their hearts. Jim believes this will be the last time they '
                 'will see each other and he tries to memorize the prairie, '
                 'the fields, and the tall grass, wishing he were a boy again '
                 'with a laughing Ántonia running beside him. Twenty years '
                 'later, Jim Burden sees Ántonia on a trip to Black Hawk. She '
                 'has married well to Anton Cuzak, a cousin of Anton Jelinek. '
                 'They have many children and Jim spends an evening looking at '
                 'old photographs with them and hearing the stories of the '
                 "past from Ántonia's children. Meeting her husband, Jim finds "
                 'that Cuzak already seems to know him because Ántonia has '
                 'described him so well to her whole family. Happy and '
                 'contented, Ántonia is rooted in the prairie and the Nebraska '
                 'farmland. When Jim leaves, he promises to return and take '
                 'the Cuzak boys hunting the next summer. Reflecting on the '
                 'past, Jim realizes that many of his old friends have died or '
                 'moved away, but he still has memories and longings for the '
                 'prairie. He remembers the train trip so long ago where he '
                 'first saw the frightened and small immigrant girl, Ántonia. '
                 'Now she seems larger than life, like the plow against the '
                 'sunset, acclimated to the prairie land. In contrast, Jim '
                 'seems rootless, traveling and adrift in life. He vows to '
                 'return to the prairie where he felt a peace and contentment '
                 'that eludes him in the East, and where Ántonia and her '
                 'family share his past.',

{'author': 'William Shakespeare',
 'book_title': 'The Merchant of Venice',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Antonio, a leading merchant of Venice, is a wealthy, '
                 'respected, and popular man. Among his many friends is a '
                 'young man named Bassanio, who owes Antonio a good deal of '
                 'money. Bassanio would like to repay his friend, but so far '
                 'he has been unable to do so. However, he now feels that he '
                 'may have found a way — but he will again need a loan from '
                 'Antonio. In Belmont, Bassanio tells Antonio, there lives a '
                 'beautiful and young and wealthy heiress. Bassanio feels sure '
                 'that he can win her hand in marriage, but he cannot go '
                 'courting "hands-hanging." If he is to make a good '
                 'impression, he has to appear at least as well off as her '
                 'other wealthy suitors. Antonio tells his young friend that '
                 'he would gladly lend him whatever amount of money he needs, '
                 'but at the present time he himself is short of cash. All of '
                 'his money is tied up in his merchant ships, which are still '
                 'at sea. However, Antonio will not disappoint Bassanio. He '
                 'knows of a moneylender who will probably lend him the '
                 "necessary amount, and Bassanio can use Antonio's good name "
                 'as security for the loan. At Belmont, Portia speaks to '
                 'Nerissa, her confidante, telling her how tired she is of the '
                 'constant stream of suitors, and how she wishes to be free of '
                 "the perverse obligation of her father's will: Portia cannot "
                 'choose her own husband; she can marry only the man who '
                 'chooses the correct one of three caskets — one gold, one '
                 'silver, and one lead; one contains her portrait and that one '
                 'is the lucky casket. So far, none of her suitors has decided '
                 'to risk choosing one of the caskets, which is all for the '
                 'good, because Portia has no liking for any of them. However, '
                 'when Nerissa mentions the name of Bassanio, a possible '
                 "suitor, Portia's mood brightens. He was once a visitor at "
                 'Belmont, and Portia was impressed with him. Meanwhile in '
                 'Venice, Shylock, a rich Jewish moneylender who harbors a '
                 'secret hatred for Antonio, has agreed to lend Bassanio three '
                 "thousand ducats for three months, on Antonio's bond. "
                 'Foregoing his usual high interest rate, Shylock demands '
                 'instead that if the day for payment falls due and the money '
                 'is not returned, he may cut off one pound of flesh from '
                 "Antonio's body. Antonio agrees because all of his ships are "
                 'due back in Venice a full month before the bond falls due. A '
                 'romantic subplot develops when Lorenzo, a close friend of '
                 "Antonio and Bassanio, falls in love with Shylock's daughter, "
                 'Jessica. He manages to elope with her by disguising her as a '
                 'boy, and she manages to take with her a goodly amount of her '
                 "father's ducats. Of course, this infuriates Shylock, and he "
                 'vows revenge. Shortly thereafter, Bassanio and Gratiano '
                 'leave for Belmont, where the "fair Portia" has just sent '
                 'away the Prince of Morocco and the Prince of Arragon, two '
                 'more disappointed, unsuccessful suitors. When Bassanio asks '
                 'to choose one of the caskets, Portia falls immediately in '
                 'love with him, and she begs him to wait a few days before '
                 'choosing one of the caskets. He has fallen in love with '
                 'Portia and insists on taking his chances. He rejects the '
                 'gold one, then the silver one; he chooses, finally, the lead '
                 'casket, and on opening it, he finds a portrait of Portia. '
                 'Both he and Portia are overjoyed, and they make plans to be '
                 'married at once, along with Nerissa and Gratiano, who have '
                 'also fallen in love. Happiness reigns in Belmont until '
                 'Bassanio is brought a letter from Antonio bidding him '
                 'farewell since his ships have been lost at sea and since it '
                 'is impossible that he will live after Shylock collects his '
                 'pound of flesh. Horrified, Bassanio leaves instantly for '
                 'Venice with money which Portia gives him to pay the bond. In '
                 'Venice, Shylock is no longer interested in the mere payment '
                 'of the money due him. He wants revenge. A Christian stole '
                 'his daughter (and she took his money), and nothing will '
                 'satisfy Shylock except the legal fulfillment of the bond. In '
                 'the court of justice, presided over by the Duke of Venice, '
                 'Shylock faces his enemy, Antonio. Antonio is surrounded by '
                 'his friends and is quietly resigned to death. On all sides, '
                 'Shylock is surrounded by enemies. Bassanio pleads with '
                 'Shylockto accept double the money due him, but Shylock '
                 'refuses. At this point, Portia, disguised as a lawyer, and '
                 'Nerissa, dressed as her law clerk, enter the court and tell '
                 'the Duke that they have been sent from Padua by a learned '
                 "attorney, Doctor Bellario, to plead the defendant's case. "
                 'Portia entreats Shylock to be merciful, but he will not '
                 'listen. She offers the moneylender triple the amount owed '
                 'him, but again Shylock will have none of it. She then '
                 'solemnly informs the court that Shylock is entirely within '
                 'his lawful rights. She then informs Shylock that he must be '
                 'very careful. He must cutoff exactly one pound of flesh, and '
                 "he must not spill one drop of Antonio's blood. If he fails, "
                 "all of Shylock's lands and goods will be confiscated. "
                 'Shylock hastily decides that he will accept the triple '
                 'payment of the bond, but Portia says no; Shylock then offers '
                 'to take only the original three thousand ducats, but again '
                 'Portia refuses, reminding him that it was he himself who '
                 'demanded the strict interpretation of the law. Furthermore, '
                 'she says, the law has another hold on him. Since he is an '
                 'alien in Venice and since he tried to "seek the life" of a '
                 'Venetian citizen, all his wealth can be divided between the '
                 'citizen whom he attempted to destroy and the public '
                 "treasury; in addition, Shylock's own life is in peril "
                 'because of what he attempted to do. The Duke decides to '
                 "spare Shylock's life, but he does give half of Shylock's "
                 'money to Antonio, and he gives the rest of it to the state. '
                 'Antonio says that he will not accept the money if Shylock '
                 'will agree to become a Christian and if, in his will, he '
                 'will agree to leave his money to his daughter, Jessica, and '
                 'her new husband, Lorenzo. Shylock, broken and defeated, '
                 'agrees to all these conditions and leaves the court. '
                 'Overjoyed, Antonio and his friends offer to pay the young '
                 'lawyer whatever they can, but, oddly enough, the lawyer '
                 'wishes only a certain ring which Bassanio is wearing. '
                 'Bassanio is embarrassed because his wife gave this ring to '
                 'him and asked him to wear it always. But the lawyer insists '
                 "and, finally, Bassanio reluctantly gives away Portia's ring. "
                 'Nerissa likewise cleverly manages to get from Gratiano a '
                 'ring she gave him. The two ladies then hasten back to '
                 'Belmont to tease their husbands about the rings. When '
                 'Bassanio and Gratiano, along with Antonio, return to '
                 'Belmont, their wives inquire about the missing rings. Portia '
                 'and Nerissa insist that the men no doubt gave the rings away '
                 'to two other women. The husbands swear that it is not true, '
                 'and it is not until Portia and Nerissa have put their '
                 'husbands through some long, comically agonizing moments of '
                 'discomfort that they confess that they themselves were the '
                 '"learned doctor" and the "clerk" to whom the rings were '
                 'given. Thus all ends happily, as Portia gives Antonio a '
                 'letter informing him that three of his ships have arrived '
                 'safely in port.',

 'summary_text': 'Alceste, the misanthrope, explains to Philinte that he hates '
                 'mankind because there is so much hypocrisy, deceit, and '
                 "false flattery in the world that he can't find a man who "
                 'will speak the truth openly. He asserts that all people '

                 'Philinte asks Alceste to be more tolerant because it is a '

                 'certain amount of gossip. At this point, a fashionable man '

                 'with the same charm and grace. She tells him that it is '
                 'better to treat all people equally than for her to closet '
                 'herself and heap all her favors on one person. In the midst '
                 'of the argument, two fops, Acaste and Clitandre, arrive, '
                 'followed by Philinte and Eliante, a woman of good reasonable '
                 'sense. The fops immediately begin gossiping about various '
                 "members of the court, and to Alceste's chagrin, Célimène "
                 'joins in the gossip by castigating every person who is '
                 'mentioned. Alceste cannot tolerate this, and tries to stop '
                 'the performance. Shortly afterward, an officer arrives with '
                 'a summons for Alceste. He is to appear before the court of '
                 "the marshals because of his comments about Oronte's poem. "
                 "Later at Célimène's house, the two fops talk about her, but "
                 'abruptly cease when she appears. Soon afterward a servant '
                 'announces the arrival of Arsinoé a lady of society. When the '
                 'fops leave, Arsinoé pretends to inform Célimène of the '
                 'gossip being spread about her. In turn, Célimène tells '
                 'Arsinoé what is being said about her. When Alceste arrives, '
                 'Célimène excuses herself and leaves Arsinoé and Alceste '
                 'together. Immediately, Arsinoé begins flattering Alceste and '
                 'offers to show him proof that Célimène is false to him. In '
                 'the following scene Philinte reports to Eliante that Alceste '
                 "would not retract what he had said about Oronte's poem. "
                 'Eliante admits that she must admire a man who sticks to his '
                 'opinion so firmly; in fact she would not mind having him as '
                 'a suitor. Philinte then confesses his love for Eliante and '
                 'his own desire for her hand if she does not become involved '
                 'with Alceste. When Alceste arrives, he is in a rage against '
                 'Célimène for being false. Arsinoé has given him a love '
                 'letter which appears to be from Célimène to someone else. '
                 'When he confronts Célimène with the proof, she simply '
                 'ignores it and suggests that it might have been written to a '
                 'woman and not a man. She then accuses Alceste of being too '
                 'strict and of not caring for her. Before the argument is '
                 'settled, Alceste is reminded of a lawsuit against him, which '
                 'he is apparently about to lose and which must be tended to '
                 'immediately. Later, Alceste is complaining to Philinte about '
                 'the injustice in human society: He has indeed lost his '
                 'lawsuit even though his case was a just one. He decides that '
                 'he will retire from mankind and live in solitude. When '
                 'Célimène comes in accompanied by Oronto, both men insist '
                 'that she choose one of them. She avoids making a choice and '
                 'before the two men can force her, the two fops, Clitandre '
                 'and Acaste, arrive with incriminating letters which Célimène '
                 'has written. In these letters, she made derogatory remarks '
                 'about all of the gentlemen. The fops leave, promising to '
                 'publish her perfidy to all of society. Oronte also gives up '
                 'his suit to Célimène. Left alone with Alceste, Célimène '
                 'acknowledges her mistake and offers her hand to Alceste if '
                 'he will still have her. He then tells her that he wants to '
                 'retire from society and wants her to join him in solitude. '
                 'But Célimène cannot forego society, and at this point '
                 'Alceste is cured of his love for Célimène and dismisses her. '
                 'He then promises to live alone and rail against all of '
                 'society and mankind.',

 'summary_text': '"Call me Ishmael," the narrator begins, in one of the most '
                 'recognizable opening lines in American literature. This '
                 'observant young man from Manhattan has been to sea four '
                 'times in the merchant service but yearns for a whaling '
                 'adventure. On a cold, gloomy night in December, he arrives '
                 'at the Spouter-Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees '
                 'to share a bed with a stranger. Both men are alarmed when '
                 'the bunkmate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named '
                 'Queequeg, returns late and discovers Ishmael beneath his '
                 'covers. But the two soon become good friends and decide to '
                 'sail together from the historical port of Nantucket. In '
                 'Nantucket, they sign on with the Pequod , Queequeg the more '
                 'attractive employee due to his excellence with the harpoon. '
                 'Ishmael, lacking any further ambition, will be a common '
                 "sailor. The ship's captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; "
                 'nevertheless, they hear of him. He is a "grand, ungodly, '
                 'god-like man" (Chapter 16), according to one of the owners, '
                 'a man of few words but deep meaning, who has been in '
                 'colleges as well as among the cannibals. A raggedy prophet '
                 'of doom named Elijah catches the two friends on the dock and '
                 'hints at trouble with Ahab. The mystery grows on Christmas '
                 'morning when Ishmael spots dark figures in the mist, '
                 'apparently boarding the Pequod shortly before it sets sail. '
                 "The ship's officers direct the early voyage. The chief mate, "
                 'Starbuck, is a sincere Quaker and fine leader. Second mate '
                 'is Stubb, a prankster but an able seaman. Third mate is '
                 'Flask, dull but competent. When Ahab finally appears on his '
                 'quarter-deck one morning, he is an imposing, frightening '
                 'figure whose haunted visage sends shivers over the narrator. '
                 'A white scar, reportedly from a thunderbolt, runs down his '
                 'face and, they say, the length of his body. He has a grim, '
                 'determined look. One leg is missing and replaced by a '
                 "prosthesis fashioned from a sperm whale's jaw. Ahab finally "
                 'gathers the crewmen together and, in a rousing speech, '
                 'solicits their support in a single purpose for this voyage: '
                 'hunting down and killing the White Whale — Moby Dick, a very '
                 'large sperm whale with a snow-white head. Only Starbuck '
                 'resists the charismatic, monomaniacal captain; the first '
                 "mate argues repeatedly that the ship's purpose should be to "
                 'gather whale oil and return home safely. Eventually, even '
                 'Starbuck acquiesces. The mystery of the dark figures is '
                 "explained during the voyage's first chase, long before "
                 'meeting Moby Dick. Ahab has secretly brought along his own '
                 'boat crew, led by an ancient Asian named Fedallah, an '
                 'inscrutable figure with an odd influence over Ahab. Later, '
                 'while guarding a captured whale one night, Fedallah tells '
                 "Ahab of a prophecy of his (Ahab's death). Queequeg becomes "
                 "deathly ill and orders a canoe-shaped coffin from the ship's "
                 'carpenter. Just as everyone has given up hope, the island '
                 'aborigine decides to live and soon recovers. The coffin '
                 'serves as his sea chest and later is caulked and pitched to '
                 "become the ship's life buoy. Queequeg heroically rescues two "
                 'drowning men in the novel; his coffin will save a third. '
                 'There are numerous "gams" in the novel, social meetings of '
                 'two ships on the open sea. Crews normally visit each other '
                 'during a gam, captains on one vessel and chief mates on the '
                 'other. Newspapers and mail are exchanged. The men talk of '
                 'whale sightings or other news. For Ahab, however, there is '
                 'but one relevant question to ask of another ship: "Hast seen '
                 'the White Whale?" Some have. The captain of the Samuel '
                 'Enderby lost an arm to the leviathan. The Rachel has also '
                 'seen Moby Dick. As a result, one of its open boats is '
                 "missing; the captain's son is aboard. The captain of the "
                 "Rachel begs Ahab to aid in the search, but the Pequod 's "
                 'captain is resolute. He is very near the White Whale now and '
                 'will not stop to help. Ahab is the first to spot Moby Dick. '
                 'For three days, the crew pursues the great whale, who '
                 "repeatedly turns on the Pequod 's boats, wreaking "
                 'destruction and killing Fedallah, sinking the Pequod , and '
                 'dragging Ahab into the sea and his death. Only Ishmael '
                 "survives, clinging to Queequeg's coffin. He floats for a day "
                 'and a night before the Rachel rescues him.',

{'author': 'William Shakespeare',
 'book_title': 'The Merry Wives of Windsor',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Merry Wives of Windsor is the most purely farcical of '
                 "all of Shakespeare's plays. It depends on lightning-quick "
                 'timing between the actors and the carefully choreographed '
                 'actions. The "meaning" cannot be separated from the '
                 '"performance." The incidents themselves are as follows: '
                 'There is a main plot in which Sir John Falstaff conspires to '
                 'seduce Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford, the wives of two prominent '
                 'Windsor citizens. The women play along with him in order to '
                 'expose him as a preposterous lecher. Then, to complicate '
                 'matters, the insanely jealous Mr. Ford disguises himself as '
                 'one "Mr. Brook" and hires Falstaff to procure Mrs. Ford for '
                 'him in order to (so he plans) reveal her suspected '
                 'infidelity. But Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page dupe both Falstaff '
                 'and Mr. Ford. On one occasion, Falstaff is tricked into '
                 'hiding in a basket of dirty clothes, then dropped into the '
                 'river ("I have a kind of alacrity in sinking," he says); on '
                 'another occasion, he must disguise himself as a fat old '
                 'woman, a "witch" much hated by Mr. Ford, who summarily '
                 'pummels "her"/him. Finally, both husbands join their "merry '
                 'wives" in an elaborate masque-like entertainment, the high '
                 'point of which is the humiliation of Falstaff, who has this '
                 'time disguised himself as the ghostly "Herne the Hunter," '
                 'complete with a massive set of horns on his head. The '
                 'secondary plot concerns the comical antics of a pair of '
                 'would-be suitors for the hand of the lovely Anne Page. '
                 'Doctor Caius, a quick-tempered French doctor, and Slender, '
                 "the stupid nephew of Justice Shallow, vie for Anne's favor, "

                 'into conflict with Doctor Caius, and because the Welshman '
                 'Evans and the Frenchman Caius persistently garble the '
                 'English language, their meetings and arguments give special '
                 'pleasure to all present. In the end, Anne Page marries her '
                 'true-love, a poor young gentleman named Fenton. Mr. Ford '
                 'promises to desist from being jealous of his wife, Falstaff '
                 'is made a laughing stock, and then he is reconciled to the '

                 'has been extended an invitation by Captain William Bligh to '
                 'embark on an expedition to Tahiti to gather breadfruit trees '
                 'and take them to the West Indies, where they will be planted '

                 'is expected to formulate a dictionary of the Tahitian '
                 'language. The Bounty sets sail in November 1787, and its '
                 'crew is introduced to the reader. The ship makes calls on '
                 'several islands during its journey to Tahiti, and, '
                 'meanwhile, conditions aboard the ship begin to deteriorate. '
                 'Food rots, the crew suspects Bligh of hoarding food for '

                 'is mounting among the crew. The Bounty reaches Tahiti, and '
                 'Byam begins studying the Tahitian language with the aid of '
                 'some of the natives. Members of the crew begin the task of '
                 'digging up young breadfruit trees and storing them on board '
                 'the ship. Many of the men form attachments to the Tahitian '
                 'women, and the realization that the Bounty will soon be '
                 'sailing from this idyllic life causes grumbling among the '
                 'crew. Not surprisingly, three men desert before the ship '
                 'leaves. The Bounty sets sail for the West Indies to deliver '
                 'the trees, and early in the voyage, Bligh harasses his crew '
                 '— in particular, he accuses some of them of stealing '
                 'coconuts. His officers, notably Fletcher Christian, begin '
                 'grumbling over the poor treatment that they are receiving at '
                 'the hands of Bligh. Accordingly, one morning, some of the '
                 'crew, led by Christian, seize the ship and force Bligh, '
                 "along with some of Bligh's followers, into the Bounty's "
                 'launch to fend for themselves on the high seas. Those who '
                 'wish to accompany Bligh but cannot because of the '
                 'already-crowded conditions in the launch are forced to '
                 'remain with the mutineers aboard the Bounty. Christian '
                 'immediately begins sailing the South Sea in search of an '
                 'uninhabited island, but finding none and tired of the '
                 'complaints of his fellow mutineers, Christian returns to '
                 'Tahiti, where he drops off those who wish to stay on the '
                 'island, including Byam. Then he resumes his search for an '
                 'unchartered and uninhabited island. Byam eases himself back '
                 'into the idyllic life he experienced the first time on the '
                 'island, and soon he marries a Tahitian princess. A child is '
                 'born to the couple, and life on Tahiti continues to be a '
                 'paradise-until an English ship drops anchor at the island. '
                 'Byam rows out to meet the vessel and is immediately '
                 'imprisoned as a mutineer, along with the other Englishmen on '
                 'the island. While taking the prisoners back to England to be '
                 'tried for mutiny, the ship runs aground on a reef and sinks, '
                 'but not before the crew and prisoners have taken refuge in '
                 "the ship's smaller boats. The small boats make an open-sea "
                 'journey, and finally, after several months of sailing and '
                 'torturous conditions, they reach land safely. The mutineers '
                 'are imprisoned aboard another vessel, which takes them back '
                 'to England to await their court-martial. The court-martial '
                 'of Byam and his companions begins. Testimony is given by the '
                 'men of the Bounty who made it back to England. Byam and the '
                 'other men are then allowed to present their defenses. The '
                 'judges deliberate and find Byam, along with five of the '

                 'other three, Byam included, are spared the rope only hours '
                 'before their seemingly inevitable deaths. Byam is spared '

 'summary_text': 'Winston Smith is a member of the Outer Party. He works in '
                 'the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth, rewriting '
                 "and distorting history. To escape Big Brother 's tyranny, at "
                 'least inside his own mind, Winston begins a diary — an act '
                 'punishable by death. Winston is determined to remain human '
                 'under inhuman circumstances. Yet telescreens are placed '
                 'everywhere — in his home, in his cubicle at work, in the '
                 'cafeteria where he eats, even in the bathroom stalls. His '
                 'every move is watched. No place is safe. One day, while at '
                 'the mandatory Two Minutes Hate, Winston catches the eye of '
                 "an Inner Party Member, O'Brien , whom he believes to be an "
                 'ally. He also catches the eye of a dark-haired girl from the '
                 'Fiction Department, whom he believes is his enemy and wants '
                 'him destroyed. A few days later, Julia , the dark-haired '
                 'girl whom Winston believes to be against him, secretly hands '
                 'him a note that reads, "I love you." Winston takes pains to '
                 'meet her, and when they finally do, Julia draws up a '
                 'complicated plan whereby they can be alone. Alone in the '
                 'countryside, Winston and Julia make love and begin their '
                 'allegiance against the Party and Big Brother. Winston is '
                 'able to secure a room above a shop where he and Julia can go '
                 'for their romantic trysts. Winston and Julia fall in love, '
                 'and, while they know that they will someday be caught, they '
                 'believe that the love and loyalty they feel for each other '
                 'can never be taken from them, even under the worst '
                 'circumstances. Eventually, Winston and Julia confess to '
                 "O'Brien, whom they believe to be a member of the Brotherhood "
                 '(an underground organization aimed at bringing down the '
                 "Party), their hatred of the Party. O'Brien welcomes them "
                 'into the Brotherhood with an array of questions and arranges '
                 'for Winston to be given a copy of "the book," the '
                 "underground's treasonous volume written by their leader, "
                 'Emmanuel Goldstein , former ally of Big Brother turned '
                 'enemy. Winston gets the book at a war rally and takes it to '
                 'the secure room where he reads it with Julia napping by his '
                 'side. The two are disturbed by a noise behind a painting in '
                 'the room and discover a telescreen. They are dragged away '
                 'and separated. Winston finds himself deep inside the '
                 'Ministry of Love, a kind of prison with no windows, where he '
                 "sits for days alone. Finally, O'Brien comes. Initially "
                 "Winston believes that O'Brien has also been caught, but he "
                 "soon realizes that O'Brien is there to torture him and break "
                 'his spirit. The Party had been aware of Winston\'s "crimes" '
                 "all along; in fact, O'Brien has been watching Winston for "
                 "the past seven years. O'Brien spends the next few months "
                 'torturing Winston in order to change his way of thinking — '
                 'to employ the concept of doublethink , or the ability to '
                 "simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in one's mind and "
                 'believe in them both. Winston believes that the human mind '
                 'must be free, and to remain free, one must be allowed to '
                 "believe in an objective truth, such as 2 + 2 = 4. O'Brien "
                 'wants Winston to believe that 2 + 2 = 5, but Winston is '
                 "resistant. Finally, O'Brien takes Winston to Room 101, the "
                 'most dreaded room of all in the Ministry of Love, the place '
                 "where prisoners meet their greatest fear. Winston's greatest "
                 "fear is rats. O'Brien places over Winston's head a mask made "
                 'of wire mesh and threatens to open the door to release rats '
                 'on Winston\'s face. When Winston screams, "Do it to Julia!" '
                 'he relinquishes his last vestige of humanity. Winston is a '
                 'changed man. He sits in the Chestnut Tree Café, watching the '
                 'telescreens and agonizing over the results of daily battles '
                 'on the front lines. He has seen Julia again. She, too, is '
                 'changed, seeming older and less attractive. She admits that '
                 'she also betrayed him. In the end, there is no doubt, '
                 'Winston loves Big Brother.',

{'author': 'Emile Zola',
 'book_title': 'Nana',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Monsieur Fauchery, the drama critic, takes his cousin la '
                 'Faloise to the theater for the opening of a new musical '
                 'featuring an exciting new star known simply as Nana. At the '
                 'theater, the two men recognize many people from the '
                 'fashionable world, among them, the pious Count Muffat de '
                 'Beuville and his wife, Countess Sabine. When Nana appears '
                 'onstage, it is obvious that she has no talent, but she '
                 'possesses one outstanding quality — she is the epitome of '
                 'sexuality. At first the audience laughs until a young boy, '
                 'Georges Hugon, cries out, "She\'s wonderful." From then '
                 'until the end of the play, Nana is in control of the '
                 'audience, especially during the final act when she appears '
                 'on the stage virtually naked. The next day, while Nana is '
                 'making arrangements to receive her lovers, fans who had seen '
                 'her the preceding evening begin to call upon her. Among the '
                 'visitors are Count Muffat and his father-in-law, the Marquis '
                 'de Chouard, who pretends to come to collect money for a '
                 'charitable organization. Both men are visibly affected by '
                 'the presence of Nana. A wealthy banker named Steiner also '
                 'comes, and even though he has a reputation for spending '
                 'fortunes on actresses, Nana refuses to see him. The '
                 'following week, at a party given by the Count Muffat, the '
                 'discussion between the men concerns a party that Nana is '
                 'giving after her performance. She has told Fauchery to '
                 'invite the count to the party, but most of the men think '
                 'that he will not accept. At the party, more people come than '
                 'Nana had expected; but the count does not come. At the end '
                 'of the party, Nana decides it is time to look after her own '
                 'interest and lets Steiner know that she will accept him as a '
                 "lover. As Nana's reputation spreads, soon foreign "
                 'dignitaries begin to come to the theater to see her. Count '
                 'Muffat must accompany an English prince to the theater and '
                 'while there can hardly constrain himself because Nana has '
                 'aroused in him unknown desires. Before the prince takes her '
                 'away for the evening, the count discovers that Steiner has '
                 'bought her a country house close to a family he often '
                 'visits. She tells him to come see her there. The country '
                 'house is owned by Madame Hugon, the mother of Georges, who '
                 'shouted in the theater that Nana was wonderful. When Georges '
                 "hears about Nana's visit, he goes to see her. He is so young "
                 'that Nana does not want to accept him as a lover, but after '
                 'some mild persuasion she succumbs. This new relationship '
                 'pleases her so much that she decides to postpone her affair '
                 "with Count Muffat. After a week, however, Georges' "
                 'relationship is discovered and his mother forces him to '
                 "remain at home. Then Count Muffat slips into Nana's bedroom "
                 'and begins his love affair with her. Three months later, '
                 'Nana begins to resent the fact that Count Muffat never gives '
                 'her much money. Furthermore, she has formed an infatuation '
                 'for an actor named Fontan. When both Muffat and Steiner '
                 'arrive and find her in bed with Fontan, Nana throws both her '
                 'old lovers out and decides to be true to Fontan. However, '
                 'the actor soon tires of Nana and begins beating her '
                 'brutally. Finally, he even locks her out of her apartment. '
                 'Nana now decides to renew her relationship with Count Muffat '
                 'but makes it clear to him that she expects much more than '
                 'she previously received. The count agrees to all her '
                 'demands, buys her an expensive mansion, furnishes it '
                 'elegantly, and gives her twelve thousand francs a month for '
                 'expenses. Still Nana is not satisfied; she begins to have '
                 'relations with other men, even men whom she picks up from '
                 'the streets. Out of boredom, she begins to experiment with '
                 'lesbian love and finds that it is rather pleasant. Count '
                 'Muffat must learn to accept all of her vagaries or else '
                 'leave. By now he is so completely enslaved that he cannot '
                 'deny her anything. At the famous race, the Prix de Paris, '
                 'one of the horses is named after Nana. Everyone comes to the '
                 'race and many bet on the filly, Nana. After the race, which '
                 'is won by Nana, the owner of the stable, Count Vandeuvres, '
                 'is suspected of some shady transactions and commits suicide '
                 'by setting fire to himself and his stables. Nana, however, '
                 'is celebrated because her namesake won the race. No amount '
                 'of money or pleasure seems to satisfy Nana. She begins to '
                 'spend money so wildly that she has to have many more lovers '
                 'to supply her insatiable demands. Quickly, she begins to go '
                 'through the fortunes of many men and leaves them destitute '
                 'and bankrupt. Through all of her experiences, the count '
                 'remains imprisoned by her capricious behavior. Only when he '
                 'unexpectedly discovers her in bed with his decrepit '
                 'father-in-law is he shocked back into his senses. But by '
                 'then, he too is a broken man. One day, Nana disappears from '
                 'Paris. No one knows of her whereabouts, but rumors begin to '
                 'grow up about her. All of the rumors concern huge sums of '
                 'money and fantastic lovers for Nana. One day, it is '
                 'discovered that Nana is in a hotel in Paris dying of '
                 'smallpox. Many of the old actresses and courtesans go there '
                 "to see her, but they are too late. Now, only Nana's body, "
                 'corrupted by the ravages of the disease, lies unclaimed in '
                 'the austere hotel room.',

{'author': 'Frederick Douglass',
 'book_title': 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "Douglass' Narrative begins with the few facts he knows about "
                 'his birth and parentage; his father is a slave owner and his '
                 'mother is a slave named Harriet Bailey. Here and throughout '
                 'the autobiography, Douglass highlights the common practice '
                 'of white slave owners raping slave women, both to satisfy '
                 'their sexual hungers and to expand their slave populations. '
                 'In the first chapter, Douglass also makes mention of the '
                 'hypocrisy of Christian slave owners who used religious '
                 'teachings to justify their abhorrent treatment of slaves; '
                 'the religious practice of slave owners is a recurrent theme '
                 'in the text. Throughout the next several chapters, Douglass '
                 'describes the conditions in which he and other slaves live. '
                 'As a slave of Captain Anthony and Colonel Lloyd, Douglass '
                 'survives on meager rations and is often cold. He witnesses '
                 'brutal beatings and the murder of a slave, which goes '
                 'unnoticed by the law or the community at large. Douglass '
                 'argues against the notion that slaves who sing are content; '
                 'instead, he likens singing to crying — a way to relieve '
                 'sorrow. Douglass also draws attention to the false system of '
                 'values created by slavery, in which allegiance to the slave '
                 'master is far stronger than an allegiance to other slaves. '
                 'When he is seven or eight years old, Douglass is sent to '
                 'Baltimore to live with the Auld family and care for their '
                 'son, Thomas. Mrs. Auld gives Douglass reading lessons until '
                 'her husband intervenes; Douglass continues his lessons by '
                 'trading bread for lessons with poor neighborhood white boys '
                 "and by using Thomas' books. Soon, Douglass discovers "
                 'abolitionist movements in the North, including those by '
                 'Irish Catholics. Several years later, as a result of his '
                 "original owner's death, Douglass finds himself being lent to "
                 'a poor farmer with a reputation for "breaking" slaves. '
                 'Douglass spends a year with Covey, who cruelly and brutally '
                 'whips the slave until Douglass finally fights him. From that '
                 'day on, Covey leaves Douglass alone. Douglass lives for a '
                 'time with William Freeland, a kind master, and Douglass '
                 'finds a family among the other slaves there. Douglass '
                 'becomes a Sunday school teacher to other slaves, a position '
                 'he enjoys. Although this situation is better than any he has '
                 'experienced, it is still a far cry from freedom, so Douglass '
                 'attempts to escape by canoeing up the Chesapeake Bay. He is '
                 'caught and eventually finds himself working again for Hugh '
                 'Auld in Baltimore. First, he runs errands for shipyard '
                 'workers, but he after some of the workers heckle and strike '
                 'Douglass, he fights back and is nearly beaten to death. '
                 'Working at a different shipyard after the fight, Douglass '
                 'becomes proficient at ship caulking, but he is forced to '
                 'turn his wages over to Auld. Douglass soon makes an '
                 'arrangement with Auld to hire himself out and give Auld a '
                 'set amount of wages each week. Douglass is allowed to pocket '
                 'the rest, thus saving enough for his escape to New York. '
                 'After his escape, Douglass is advised to move to New '
                 'Bedford, Massachusetts, and he settles there with his new '
                 'wife, Anna Murray. Douglass makes a living doing odd jobs; '

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Mrs. Dalloway is a unique novel in that it takes place in a '
                 'single day — a Wednesday in mid-June 1923. The novel '
                 'interweaves two seemingly unconnected storylines during this '
                 'day. At the beginning, Clarissa Dalloway, fiftyish and '
                 'recently recovering from an illness, is preparing for a '
                 'party she will host that evening. She begins her day running '
                 'an errand to purchase the flowers for the party. Throughout '
                 'the morning, Clarissa reflects on her past, including her '
                 'decision to marry Richard Dalloway thirty years earlier, '
                 'rather than her more fiery suitor Peter Walsh. Meanwhile, '
                 'the second storyline begins with Septimus Smith, a '
                 'shellshocked war veteran, out on the street with his wife, '
                 'Lucrezia. Septimus struggles with the aftereffects of the '
                 'war, hearing voices and feeling that life has little '
                 'meaning. A car backfiring paralyzes him, and he reflects on '
                 'his life. Septimus lost his good friend and commanding '
                 'officer Evans in the war and continues to carry on '
                 'conversations with this lost friend. Clarissa has returned '
                 'home and begins to remember a special friendship she shared '
                 'in her youth with Sally Seton, a vivacious, slightly '
                 'scandalous young woman. The two shared a special bond, '
                 'bordering on a crush, and Clarissa remembers a kiss they '
                 'shared. Clarissa begins mending her green silk dress for the '
                 'evening when she receives an unexpected visit from Peter '
                 'Walsh, her former suitor. Peter had once told Clarissa '
                 'disparagingly that one day she would become "the perfect '
                 'hostess," and it becomes more and more clear that his '
                 'prediction was accurate. Clarissa and Peter talk to each '
                 'other easily about the present, but both are thinking of '
                 'their past and the decisions they made to get them to the '
                 "place they are now. Clarissa's 17-year-old daughter "
                 'Elizabeth enters and Peter ends his visit. Peter goes to a '
                 'park where Septimus and Lecrezia are also walking. The '
                 'couple get into a heated discussion about suicide, and Peter '
                 'sees them as a young and in love couple quarreling. He '
                 "doesn't realize the depth of their emotions or how unsteady "
                 'Septimus is. Lecrezia has made an appointment for Septimus '
                 'to see a specialist, Sir William Bradshaw, who dismisses the '
                 "complexity of Septimus's madness and suggests a rest in an "
                 'asylum to get more perspective. Meanwhile, Richard Dalloway '
                 'has been to lunch with Lady Bruton. Clarissa was somewhat '
                 'miffed that Lady Bruton invited only Richard and not her, '
                 "and sees it as a remark on Clarissa's validity. Richard has "
                 'realized during this lunch that he wants to come home and '
                 'tell Clarissa that he loves her. Unfortunately, he never '
                 'finds the words, as he has gone so many years without saying '
                 'them. Clarissa goes to see Elizabeth, who is studying with '
                 'her tutor, Doris Kilman. Clarissa despises Doris, who she '
                 'sees as a monster with "hooves" taking her daughter from '
                 'her. Doris also despises Clarissa, largely for her bourgeois '
                 'ways and financial means. Septimus and Lecrezia go to their '
                 'apartment to wait for the attendants who will take him to '
                 'the asylum. When they arrive, Septimus decides to escape '
                 'from them, and not wanting to leave life but not wanting to '
                 'meet the attendants, he jumps out the window to his death. '
                 "Clarissa's party is underway, with several ghosts from her "
                 'past – including Peter Walsh and Sally Seton – in '
                 'attendance. Richard has still been unable to tell her that '
                 'he loves her. Very late into the party, Sir William and Lady '
                 'Bradshaw arrive, very apologetic for their tardiness. Lady '
                 'Bradshaw explains that they were delayed as one of Sir '
                 "William's patients (Septimus) had committed suicide that "
                 'day. The party ends with Clarissa surprisingly disappointed '
                 'at the success of her party.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'In 1944, in the village of Sighet, Romania, twelve-year-old '
                 'Elie Wiesel spends much time and emotion on the Talmud and '
                 'on Jewish mysticism. His instructor, Moshe the Beadle, '
                 'returns from a near-death experience and warns that Nazi '
                 'aggressors will soon threaten the serenity of their lives. '
                 'However, even when anti-Semitic measures force the Sighet '
                 "Jews into supervised ghettos, Elie's family remains calm and "
                 'compliant. In spring, authorities begin shipping trainloads '
                 "of Jews to the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. Elie's family is "
                 'part of the final convoy. In a cattle car, eighty villagers '
                 'can scarcely move and have to survive on minimal food and '
                 'water. One of the deportees, Madame Schächter, becomes '
                 'hysterical with visions of flames and furnaces. At midnight '
                 'on the third day of their deportation, the group looks in '
                 'horror at flames rising above huge ovens and gags at the '
                 'stench of burning flesh. Guards wielding billy clubs force '
                 "Elie's group through a selection of those fit to work and "
                 'those who face a grim and improbable future. Elie and his '
                 'father Chlomo lie about their ages and depart with other '
                 "hardy men to Auschwitz, a concentration camp. Elie's mother "
                 'and three sisters disappear into Birkenau, the death camp. '
                 'After viewing infants being tossed in a burning pit, Elie '
                 'rebels against God, who remains silent. Every day, Elie and '
                 'Chiomo struggle to keep their health so they can remain in '
                 'the work force. Sadistic guards and trustees exact '
                 'capricious punishments. After three weeks, Elie and his '
                 'father are forced to march to Buna, a factory in the '
                 'Auschwitz complex, where they sort electrical parts in an '
                 'electronics warehouse. The savagery reaches its height when '
                 'the guards hang a childlike thirteen year old, who dies '
                 "slowly before Elie's eyes. Despairing, Elie grows morose "
                 'during Rosh Hashanah services. At the next selection, the '
                 'doctor culls Chlomo from abler men. Chlomo, however, passes '
                 'a second physical exam and is given another chance to live. '
                 'Elie undergoes surgery on his foot. Because Russian '
                 'liberation forces are moving ever closer to the Nazi camp, '
                 'SS troops evacuate Buna in January 1945. The Wiesels and '
                 'their fellow prisoners are forced to run through a snowy '
                 'night in bitter cold over a forty-two mile route to '
                 'Gleiwitz. Elie binds his bleeding foot in strips of blanket. '
                 'Inmates who falter are shot. Elie prays for strength to save '
                 'his father from death. At a makeshift barracks, survivors '
                 'pile together. Three days later, living on mouthfuls of '
                 'snow, the remaining inmates travel in open cattle cars on a '
                 'ten-day train ride to Buchenwald in central Germany. '
                 'Finally, only the Wiesels and ten others cling to life. In '
                 'wooden bunks, Elie tries to nurse his father back to health. '
                 'Gradually, the dying man succumbs to dysentery, '
                 "malnutrition, and a vicious beating. Elie's mind slips into "
                 'semi-delirium. When he awakens, Chlomo is gone. Elie fears '
                 'that he was sent to the ovens while he was still breathing. '
                 'Resistance breaks out in Buchenwald. In April, American '
                 'forces liberate the camp. Elie is so depleted by food '

                 'Tulliver has indefinite ideas on education, and he seeks '

                 'Tulliver has already made up his mind. One result of his '
                 'hasty decision is a violent quarrel with Mrs. Glegg, to whom '
                 'he owes five hundred pounds. Tulliver fears that she will '
                 'call her money in, and he determines to head off that '
                 "possibility by paying it back at once. His sister's husband, "
                 'Mr. Moss, has borrowed three hundred pounds from him, and '
                 'Tulliver rides to see them to ask payment of the debt. But '
                 "pity for that family's poverty overcomes him, and he lets "
                 'the debt stand. Meanwhile, Tom and Maggie with their cousin '
                 'Lucy and their mother have gone to visit the Pullets. Tom '

                 'punishes her by paying no attention to her when he takes '
                 'Lucy off to the pond. Maggie takes revenge by pushing Lucy '
                 'into the mud. When Tom goes in to tell on her, Maggie runs '
                 'off to live with the gypsies and be their queen. She finds '
                 'some gypsies, but they are not what she expects, and she is '
                 'very frightened before they return her to her father. Mr. '
                 'and Mrs. Glegg have been discussing the proposition of '
                 'calling in her money from Mr. Tulliver. She is at last '
                 'convinced that it will earn more where it is, and so she is '
                 "receptive to Mrs. Pullet's suggestion (prompted by Mrs. "
                 'Tulliver) that it would be best left alone. However, Mrs. '
                 'Tulliver makes the mistake of telling her husband that Mrs. '
                 'Pullet has interceded with Mrs. Glegg. He is so angry that '
                 'he writes to Mrs. Glegg that he will pay in the money at '
                 'once. To do this he finds it necessary to borrow five '
                 'hundred pounds from a client of Lawyer Wakem. Tom turns out '
                 'to be the only pupil of Rev. Stelling, and he receives the '
                 'full benefit of an education he does not want and cannot '
                 'understand, an education consisting chiefly of Latin grammar '
                 'and geometry. When he goes home at Christmas he learns that '
                 'his father is about to go to law over water rights against a '
                 'new neighbor, Mr. Pivart, a client of Wakem. He also learns '
                 'that Philip Wakem will be his school-fellow after the '
                 'holiday. On his return to school Tom quickly decides that '
                 'Wakem is an inconsiderable person, a hunchback who is touchy '
                 "about his deformity. However, he admires Philip's ability to "

                 'between the two boys, but when Maggie leaves they quickly '
                 'grow apart again. It is two-and-a-half years later that '
                 'Maggie comes to fetch Tom home with the news that their '
                 'father has lost all his property in the lawsuit with Pivart. '
                 'Mr. Tulliver has found that the mortgage on his property '
                 '(taken out to repay Mrs. Glegg) has passed to Wakem. That '
                 'news has caused him to fall insensible. His property is all '
                 "to be sold, including Mrs. Tulliver's cherished possessions. "
                 'The relatives agree to buy in a few things which the '
                 "Tulliver's need. There is some thought that Mr. Deane's "
                 'company might buy the mill and retain Mr. Tulliver as '
                 'manager. Unfortunately, Mrs. Tulliver tries to insure this '
                 'by smoothing things with Wakem. Her plan goes wrong as Wakem '
                 'keeps the mill for himself and takes Mr. Tulliver on as a '
                 'hireling. Tom successfully applies to Mr. Deane for a '
                 'position with Guest and Company, but his father requires him '
                 'to swear on the family Bible that he will take vengeance on '
                 "Wakem. Maggie's life falls into a round of housework and "
                 'sewing. This is broken by a visit from Bob Jakin, who has '
                 'become a packman. Bob brings her a gift of books. One of '
                 'these turns out to be by Thomas a Kempis, and this book '
                 'leads her to a life of renunciation of the world until on a '
                 'walk near her home she meets Philip Wakem. Philip convinces '
                 'Maggie that she must not give up her desires and offers '
                 'himself as a friend and tutor. While Maggie struggles within '
                 'herself, Tom is at work in the business world. He saves his '
                 "money to pay off his father's debts, and under Bob Jakin's "
                 'guidance he goes into speculations of his own. He has just '
                 'saved up enough money to pay the debts when he discovers '
                 'that Maggie has been meeting Philip and that they have '
                 'declared their love for one another. By threatening to tell '
                 'their father he forces her to give up Philip. Soon after '
                 'this the debts are paid. On his first new day as an "honest '
                 'man," Tulliver meets Wakem at the mill and falls on him with '
                 'a stick. Maggie tries to hold her father back, but the '
                 'excitement causes him to take to his bed, and he dies there. '
                 'Several years later Maggie visits her cousin Lucy and is '
                 "introduced to Lucy's love, Stephen Guest. Lucy has invited "
                 "Philip Wakem to join them, for he is a friend of Stephen's. "
                 "Maggie finds it necessary to ask Tom's permission to meet "
                 'Philip. Lucy guesses that there was something between Philip '
                 'and Maggie and forces Maggie to tell her. She begins to lay '
                 'plans to bring the two together again. Tom meanwhile has '
                 'been doing very well with Guest and Company, and he is '
                 'offered a share in the business. He proposes that the '
                 'company try again to buy the mill and make him manager. The '
                 'outcome is left indefinite as he goes off on business. A '

                 'all; instead, she seizes on the mill as a way of bringing '

                 'Philip was supposed to take the two girls rowing, but he '
                 'sends Stephen in his place, so that Stephen and Maggie are '
                 'alone together. Carried away by the current of their '
                 'emotion, they row down the river past their stopping-point '

                 'had been seen with Stephen at a town downriver has been '
                 'brought by Bob Jakin, and when Maggie returns home Tom '
                 'refuses to allow her in his house. Maggie and her mother '
                 'take lodging with Bob Jakin, and Maggie finds work as a '

 'book_title': 'Oliver Twist',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "Oliver Twist's mother dies after the birth of her child in a "
                 "workhouse. The infant's father is unknown, and the orphan is "
                 'placed in a private juvenile home. After nine years of '
                 'mistreatment, the boy is returned to the workhouse for even '
                 'more abuse. After representing his fellow sufferers in an '
                 'attempt to get more food, Oliver is punished and is '
                 'apprenticed to Sowerberry, an undertaker. Noah Claypole, a '
                 "charity boy working for Oliver's master, goads Oliver to "
                 'rebellion, for which Oliver is savagely flogged. '
                 'Consequently, Oliver runs away and heads for London. Near '
                 'London, Oliver joins company with John Dawkins, The Artful '
                 'Dodger, a questionable character who brings the boy to '
                 'Fagin, the ringleader of a gang of criminals. Instructed in '
                 'the "art" of picking pockets, Oliver goes out with Charles '
                 "Bates and the Dodger. His companions pick an old gentleman's "
                 'pocket and flee, and Oliver is arrested for their offense. '
                 'At the police station, the terrified boy is cleared by the '
                 'testimony of the bookseller who witnessed the theft. Oliver '
                 'collapses and is taken home by Mr. Brownlow, the victim of '
                 "the crime. While Oliver recovers at his benefactor's home, "
                 "Brownlow is puzzled by the resemblance between Oliver's "
                 'features and the portrait of a young woman. Fagin is '
                 "apprehensive and furious at Oliver's rescue. Nancy, one of "
                 "his trusty retainers, is set on the boy's trail as the gang "
                 "shifts headquarters. Mr. Grimwig, Brownlow's friend, has no "
                 'faith in Oliver, so Oliver is sent on an errand to test his '
                 'honesty. The boy is recaptured by Nancy and her friend Bill '
                 'Sikes, a vicious lawbreaker. Oliver is restored to Fagin, '
                 'who holds him in strict captivity for a while. In the '
                 "meantime, Bumble, a minor parish official from Oliver's "
                 "birthplace, answers Brownlow's advertisement inquiring about "
                 "Oliver. Bumble turns Oliver's benefactor against him by "
                 "grossly misrepresenting the boy's history and character. "
                 'Eager to get Oliver completely in his power by thoroughly '
                 'involving the child in some crime, Fagin convinces Bill '
                 'Sikes to use Oliver in a major burglary that is being '
                 'planned. Sikes takes Oliver westward through the city to a '
                 'rendezvous near Chertsey with Toby Crackit. At the house '
                 'that is to be burglarized, Oliver is hoisted through a small '
                 'window. The occupants are aroused and in the resulting '
                 'melee, Oliver is shot. The robbers run off with the wounded '
                 'Oliver but abandon him in a ditch. In the workhouse, Sally, '
                 "the old pauper who attended Oliver's mother, is dying. At "
                 'her urgent request, Mrs. Corney, the matron, sees the old '
                 'woman alone before she expires. Immediately thereafter '
                 'Bumble and the matron agree to marry. Fagin is greatly upset '
                 'when Toby Crackit returns alone. Fagin makes anxious '
                 'inquiries about Sikes. He then has an ominous meeting with a '
                 'person called Monks, who is angry with Fagin, who he claims '
                 'has failed in his obligation to ruin Oliver by tricking him '
                 'into a lawless life When Oliver regains consciousness in a '
                 'ditch, he stumbles to the nearest house, which proves to be '
                 'the site of the attempted burglary. The owner, Mrs. Maylie, '
                 'takes the boy in and protects him with connivance of her '
                 'doctor, Mr. Losberne. The boy is taken to a cottage in the '
                 "country, where Mrs. Maylie's niece Rose suffers a near-fatal "
                 'illness. In the town inn yard, Oliver encounters a repulsive '
                 'stranger who later spies on him with Fagin. Rose rejects the '
                 "proposal of Mrs. Maylie's son, Harry, but he does not accept "
                 'her refusal as final. Monks meets the Bumbles and purchases '
                 'a locket that Mrs. Bumble redeemed with a pawn ticket that '
                 'she took away from the dead Sally, who had received the '
                 "pledge from Oliver's dying mother. The trinket contains a "
                 'ring inscribed with the name "Agnes"; Monks drops it into '
                 'the river. Nancy, who sympathizes with Oliver, nurses Sikes '
                 'until he regains his "natural" meanness. She drugs the man '
                 'and slips away to Hyde Park for a secret meeting with Rose '
                 'Maylie. Nancy tells Miss Maylie everything that she has '
                 'learned by eavesdropping on Fagin and Monks on two '
                 'occasions. The two rogues are plotting the destruction of '
                 "the object of Monks's inveterate hatred — his brother "
                 'Oliver. Mr. Brownlow, who has been absent from London, '
                 "reappears and Rose tells him Nancy's story. Harry Maylie, "
                 'Grimwig, and Mr. Losberne are also briefed on what Nancy has '
                 "learned. Noah Claypole and Charlotte, Sowerberry's "
                 'maidservant, hide out in London after she has plundered the '
                 "undertaker's till. They are discovered by Fagin, and Noah is "
                 'employed to visit the police station to bring back '
                 "information about the Dodger's indictment as a pickpocket. "
                 'Because of her suspicious behavior, Fagin then assigns the '
                 'sneak to spy on her. Nancy has a midnight meeting with Rose '
                 'and Brownlow on London Bridge. Nancy informs Brownlow how he '
                 'can corner Monks. Noah hears everything and immediately '
                 'reports his findings to Fagin. Fagin waits up for the '
                 "marauding Sikes and provokingly discloses Nancy's "
                 'double-dealing. Sikes promptly goes home and bludgeons her '
                 'to death. After wandering in the country for a day, haunted '
                 'by his evil deed, the murderer returns to London. Mr. '
                 'Brownlow has seized Monks and taken him to his home. The '
                 'resultant disclosures clear up many mysteries. Brownlow had '
                 'been engaged to the sister of his friend Edwin Leeford, '
                 "Monk's father. While yet a mere boy, Leeford was forced into "
                 'a bad marriage. The couple had only one child — Monks — and '
                 'separated. Leeford became attached to a retired naval '
                 "officer's daughter, Agnes Fleming. But Leeford died suddenly "
                 'in Rome while looking after an inheritance. His wife had '
                 'come to him from Paris just before his death. At the time, '
                 'Agnes was expecting a child — the future Oliver Twist. '
                 "Before leaving for Italy, Leeford had left the girl's "
                 'picture with his friend Brownlow. On account of the striking '
                 "similarity between Oliver's face and Agnes Fleming's, "
                 "Brownlow has been searching for Monks since the boy's "
                 "disappearance. With the help of Nancy's discoveries, "
                 "Brownlow has learned all about the destruction of Leeford's "
                 "will, the disposal of the identifying trinket that Oliver's "
                 "mother possessed, and Monks's vindictive conspiracy with "
                 'Fagin to destroy the innocent boy. Faced with these '
                 'revelations and a reminder of his complicity in the murder '
                 'of Nancy, Monks comes to terms in return for immunity on the '
                 'condition that Monks make restitution to his brother '
                 '(Oliver) in accordance with the original will. Toby Crackit '
                 'and Tom Chitling have taken refuge in a crumbling building '
                 "amid the ruins of Jacob's Island, in an inlet on the south "
                 'side of the Thames. Fagin has been arrested, along with '
                 'Claypole, while Chitling and Bates escaped. An unwelcome '
                 'addition to the group is Bill Sikes, who is being tracked '
                 'down. Charley Bates turns against the killer and raises an '
                 'alarm to guide the pursuers. Attempting to escape from the '
                 'house top, Sikes falls and is hanged in his own noose. '
                 'Oliver returns to the town of his birth with Mrs. Maylie, '
                 'Rose, and Mr. Losberne. Brownlow follows with Monks. Monks '
                 'confirms what he has already declared in writing. The past '
                 'history of the two half-brothers is recapitulated. Their '
                 "father's will left the bulk of his fortune to Agnes Fleming "
                 'and her expected child. The Bumbles admit their part in the '
                 "affair after being confronted with Monks's confession. A new "
                 'disclosure concerns Rose, who is of uncertain origin, '
                 'although recognized by Mrs. Maylie as her niece. Rose is in '
                 "reality the younger sister of Agnes Fleming, hence Oliver's "
                 'aunt. Harry Maylie has repudiated his station in life to '
                 'become a village parson, so the way is cleared for the young '
                 "couple's betrothal. Fagin is found guilty and sentenced to "
                 'be hanged. While in prison awaiting execution, he '
                 'disintegrates into a state of unrepentant maliciousness, but '
                 'on his last night, he is visited by Brownlow and Oliver. '
                 'Regaining some semblance of humanity, he reveals the '
                 "location of some papers relevant to Oliver's interests. For "
                 'testifying against Fagin, Claypole is pardoned, and he and '
                 'Charlotte live by disreputable means. Charles Bates reforms '
                 "and becomes a herdsman. The other leading members of Fagin's "
                 'gang are transported from England. In accordance with Mr. '
                 "Brownlow's recommendation, Oliver shares his fortune with "
                 'Monks, who nevertheless later dies in prison, destitute. '
                 'Rose and Harry Maylie are married, and Mrs. Maylie lives '
                 'with them. Brownlow adopts Oliver and they settle near the '
                 'parsonage, as does Mr. Losberne. The Bumbles lose their '
                 'positions and become inmates of the workhouse where Agnes '
                 'Fleming died after giving birth to Oliver Twist.',

{'author': 'Fyodor Dostoevsky',
 'book_title': 'Notes from Underground',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The narrator introduces himself as a man who lives '
                 'underground and refers to himself as a spiteful person whose '
                 'every act is dictated by his spitefulness. Then he suddenly '
                 'admits that he is not really spiteful, because he finds it '
                 "is impossible to be anything — he can't be spiteful or "
                 'heroic; he can only be nothing. This is because he is a man '
                 'of acute consciousness and such a person is automatically '
                 'rendered inactive because he considers too many consequences '
                 'of any act before he performs the act and therefore never '
                 'gets around to doing anything. In contrast, a person who is '
                 'not very intelligent can constantly perform all sorts of '
                 'actions because he never bothers to consider the '
                 'consequences. The man of acute consciousness finds that he '
                 'cannot even commit an act of revenge because he never knows '
                 'the exact nature of the insult. Such a man is plagued with '
                 'an active imagination which causes him to exaggerate any '
                 'type of insult until it becomes fantasized out of all '
                 'proportion to the original insult. By this time it is '
                 'ridiculous to try and perform any act of revenge. It is easy '
                 'for other people to classify themselves, but the Underground '
                 'Man knows that no simple classification can define the '
                 "essence of one's existence; therefore, he can only conclude "
                 'that he is nothing. Yet in society, the scientists and the '
                 'materialists are trying to define exactly what a man is in '
                 "order to create a society which will function for man's best "
                 'advantage. The Underground Man objects to this trend because '
                 "he maintains that no one can actually know what is man's "
                 'best advantage. Such a society would have to be formulated '
                 'on the theory that man is a rational being who always acts '
                 'for his best advantage. But the history of man proves that '
                 'he seldom acts this way. The Underground Man then points out '
                 'that some people love things which are not to their best '
                 'advantage. Many people, for example, need to suffer and are '
                 'ennobled by suffering; yet, the scientist and the '
                 'rationalist want to remove suffering from their utopian '
                 'society, thereby removing something that man passionately '
                 'desires. What the Underground Man wants is not scientific '
                 'certainty, but the freedom to choose his own way of life. '
                 'The Underground Man concludes that for the man of conscious '
                 'intelligence, the best thing to do is to do nothing. His '
                 'justification for writing these Notes from Underground is '
                 'that every man has some memory which he wishes to purge from '
                 'his being, and the Underground Man is going to tell his most '
                 'oppressing memory. Sixteen years ago, when he was '
                 'twenty-four, he lived a very isolated and gloomy existence '
                 'with no friends and no contacts other than his colleagues at '
                 'work. To escape the boredom of this life, he turned to a '
                 'life of imagination. There he could create scenes in which '
                 'he had been insulted and then could create ways of revenging '
                 'himself. But he never fulfilled his dreams. When his '
                 'isolation became too unbearable, he would visit his '
                 'immediate superior at his home. Once, however, feeling the '
                 'need to "embrace humanity," he was driven to renew his '
                 'acquaintance with an old schoolmate, Simonov. Arriving at '
                 'the house, he found Simonov with two old schoolmates '
                 'discussing a farewell party they were planning for Zverkov. '
                 'The Underground Man invited himself to the party even though '
                 'he had always hated Zverkov and had not seen him since their '
                 'school days. At the party, the Underground Man unknowingly '
                 'arrived an hour early (the time had been changed) and, '
                 'during the course of the evening, created a repulsive scene. '
                 'When the others left to go to a brothel, he begged for some '
                 'money from Simonov so that he could go too. He was ashamed '
                 'and horrified at what he had done, but he followed his '
                 'companions to the brothel. When he arrived, he was '
                 'determined to slap Zverkov, but he could not find him; he '
                 'was relieved to discover that everyone had already retired. '
                 'Then he met Liza, a prostitute with whom he retired. Later, '
                 'he awakened and told her in high-flown language about the '
                 'miseries of prostitution. He knew he was doing so partly for '
                 'effect and partly because he felt rejected by his friends. '
                 'Upon leaving, he gave Liza his address and told her to visit '
                 'him. She promised to do so. During the next day and for days '
                 'afterward, the Underground Man was horrified that Liza might '
                 'actually show up. He knew that he could not keep up the '
                 'pretense of the previous night. And, one night as he was '
                 'having an absurd argument with his servant, she did arrive. '
                 'He was embarrassed that she should see him in such poverty '
                 'and in such an absurd position. He went into hysterics, and '
                 'she comforted him. Later, he insulted her and told her that '
                 'he was only pretending about everything he said. Crudely, he '
                 'gave her five rubles for her services, but before she left, '
                 'she crumpled the five-ruble note and left it on his table. '
                 'He ran after her to apologize but could not find her. His '
                 'shame over his conduct still trubles him.',

                 'white mother, begins the novel by relating the real and '
                 'imagined humiliations he suffers at the hands of the '
                 'African-American hospital assistants. While their treatment '
                 'of him is tolerated, despite the fact that he is physically '
                 'much larger than they are, Chief expresses a greater fear of '
                 'Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched. The Nurse is identified as a woman '
                 'of great power and control, who is bitter because her '
                 'ruthless, machine-like efficiency is thwarted by her '
                 'naturally endowed large breasts. Despite her power, the '
                 'paranoid-schizophrenic Chief believes her to be in service '
                 'of the Combine, a large mechanized matrix that hums behind '
                 'the walls and floors of the hospital, controlling everything '
                 'from the environment to human behavior. Randle Patrick '
                 'McMurphy is introduced as a new patient on the ward. '
                 'McMurphy immediately distinguishes himself from the other '
                 'patients in the disregard he displays for all authority. He '
                 'gambles, swears, makes off-color sexual remarks, and '
                 'immediately sets himself in opposition to Nurse Ratched. '
                 'McMurphy verbalizes his views that Ratched is a '
                 '"ball-cutter." She controls the men by encouraging them to '
                 'spy on each other and participate in group sessions where '
                 'they verbally brutalize each other. At first they defend '
                 "Ratched, but eventually agree with McMurphy's assessment. He "
                 'attempts to assert his newfound leadership role among the '
                 'patients by requesting permission to watch the World Series '
                 "on the ward's television set. When this permission is "
                 'denied, he turns the television on anyway. Because she '
                 'controls power, Ratched shuts off the electricity to the '
                 'television. McMurphy, however, gets the upper hand by '
                 'insisting on watching a blank screen, an action imitated by '
                 'the other patients. In Part 2 of the novel, a lifeguard, who '
                 'is involuntarily committed to the hospital like McMurphy, '
                 "tells McMurphy that he must adhere to Ratched's rules or "
                 'risk her extending his sentence indefinitely. He backs off '
                 'from his rebellious behavior, but he has already sowed the '
                 'seeds of rebellion in his fellow patients. When McMurphy '
                 'fails to support the patient Cheswick in his assertions that '
                 'he should have access to his cigarettes, the disillusioned '
                 'man commits suicide by drowning himself in the pool where '
                 'McMurphy first decided to "toe the line." Following this '
                 'event, McMurphy is told that the other Acutes have committed '
                 'themselves of their own volition, and that they can leave '
                 'whenever they please. He returns to his rebellious behavior, '
                 'smashing a window to get at the cigarettes, a symbolic '
                 "action that alludes to Cheswick's lost battle with Ratched. "
                 'Ratched, in turn, remains passive, waiting for McMurphy to '
                 "make a mistake. Part 3 of the novel relates McMurphy's "
                 'successful attempt to take several of the patients on a '
                 'fishing trip. Ratched tries to scare the meeker patients '
                 'away from the trip by posting newspaper clippings of bad '
                 'weather and boating accidents, but the men muster their '
                 'courage and go anyway. Accompanying the men on the trip is '
                 'Doctor Spivey, a morphine addict who is blackmailed by '
                 'Ratched to acknowledge her authority, and Candy Starr, a '
                 'young prostitute who proudly displays her physical feminine '
                 'attributes. The trip galvanizes the group, and they return '
                 'to the hospital to exhibit their newfound individuality. '
                 "Part 4 begins with Ratched's attempts to make the other "
                 "patients suspicious of McMurphy's motives. She manipulates "
                 'the conversation to make it appear that McMurphy acts only '
                 'out of self-interest. This assertion appears valid to Chief, '
                 'who allows McMurphy to use his strength to win a bet against '
                 'the other patients. McMurphy, however, redeems himself in '
                 'the eyes of the other men when he defends another patient '
                 'from receiving an enema from a belligerent hospital aide. A '
                 'fight ensues, and Chief assists McMurphy. The two win the '
                 'fight but are sent to the Disturbed Ward. When McMurphy '
                 'refuses to apologize, he and Chief are given electroshock '
                 'therapy. Chief returns to the ward before McMurphy, and '
                 'discovers that he and McMurphy are now heroes to the other '
                 'men. He reveals to the patients his ability to speak and '
                 "tells the men about McMurphy. McMurphy's absence from the "
                 'ward increases his legend among the men. When he eventually '
                 'returns, McMurphy attempts to hide the mental strain he is '
                 'enduring with a false show of bravado. While the other men '
                 'have regained their sanity and sense of individuality, '
                 'McMurphy begins to behave like a parody of his old self. The '
                 'other patients realize that McMurphy is in a delicate state '
                 'and plot his escape. He refuses, however, in order to honor '
                 'a commitment he made to Billy Bibbit. Bibbit, a 31-year-old '
                 'virgin, had made a date with the prostitute Candy Starr, and '
                 'McMurphy vows to stay until Bibbit and Starr have sex. Starr '
                 'and another prostitute smuggle themselves onto the ward with '
                 'liquor, which, combined with the marijuana provided by the '
                 'African-American night watchman, Mr. Turkle, contribute to a '
                 'night of debauchery. The patients make a mess of the ward '
                 "and fall asleep after planning McMurphy's escape with Starr. "
                 'Everyone sleeps late, and McMurphy remains in the hospital '
                 'when Ratched arrives the following morning. The group '
                 'remains defiantly united against Ratched until she discovers '
                 'Bibbit sleeping with Starr. She tells Bibbit that his mother '
                 'will learn of his indiscretion, forcing Bibbit to betray his '
                 'fellow patients in general and McMurphy in particular. '
                 'Bibbit slits his throat while waiting alone in Doctor '
                 "Spivey's office, an action that Ratched blames on McMurphy's "
                 'influence. McMurphy responds by attempting to strangle her. '
                 'He fails, but rips open her uniform to expose her large '
                 'breasts, revealing her sexuality, which weakens her '
                 'authority over the patients. McMurphy is removed to the '
                 'Disturbed Ward, and many of the patients assert their '
                 'prerogative to leave the hospital. When he is returned, the '
                 'remaining patients doubt the lobotomized body is actually '
                 'McMurphy. When it is ascertained that it is indeed he, Chief '
                 "suffocates him and escapes. While Chief's escape is often "
                 "interpreted as McMurphy's final victory over Ratched, some "
                 "critics are less certain. For example, the novel's first "
                 'five pages are related as occurring in the present and '
                 'recount observations of the hospital ward, hinting that '
                 'perhaps Chief has been recommitted and that the Combine '
                 'eventually wins. Chief relates that a bluetick hound smells '
                 'his own "fear burning down into him like steam." He writes, '
                 '"It\'s gonna burn me just that way, finally telling about '
                 'all this, about the hospital, and her, and the guys — and '
                 'about McMurphy."',

                 'in a "special" prison camp in Siberia. The protagonist of '
                 'the novel is Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a former carpenter, '
                 'who has been in several of these camps for the past eight '
                 'years, serving a ten-year term for "treason." The novel — '
                 'one could better call it a short novel or a novella — '
                 'narrates the events of this day without chapter divisions, '
                 "recording Ivan's progress through the eyes of an omniscient, "
                 'third-person narrator who sometimes places himself into the '
                 "protagonist's mind, recording his thoughts and feelings as "
                 'Ivan himself would express them (see "Style and Narrative '
                 'Perspective"). When the prisoners are awakened by the sound '
                 'of a hammer clanging against a steel rail, Ivan does not get '
                 'up immediately, as is his usual practice. Instead, because '
                 'he feels feverish, he stays in bed, thinking about the '
                 'possibility of getting on the sick list. A guard pretends to '
                 'take him to the punishment cells for his tardiness, but he '
                 'really only wants Ivan to mop the floor of the guardroom. '
                 'After performing this task rather superficially, Ivan has a '
                 'meager breakfast, and then he goes to the camp hospital, '
                 'where a young poetmedic checks his temperature and then '
                 'sends him to work. After picking up his bread ration in his '
                 'barracks and hiding half of it in a hole in his mattress, '
                 'Ivan joins the rest of the prisoners for the daily roll call '
                 'and the frisking, which precedes their march to the '
                 'worksite. Ivan\'s "gang" has been assigned to continue '
                 'building a power plant, and at the heavily guarded '
                 'construction site, the prisoners try to find a warm place '
                 'while the gang bosses negotiate the daily work assignment '
                 'and the work quota which will determine their food rations. '
                 'Ivan and his work brigade will lay bricks on the second '
                 'story of the plant after they prepare the tools and the '
                 'mortar. This is a job that will fill up the hours and the '
                 'minutes until their noon break. During lunch, Ivan is able '
                 'to trick the kitchen staff into giving his gang two extra '
                 'bowls of mush, one of which he is allowed to keep for '
                 'himself. He also picks up a piece of steel which he thinks '
                 'might be useful later on, and he succeeds in buying himself '
                 'a cigarette. After the noon break, Ivan becomes so involved '
                 'in his task as a bricklayer that he loses track of time and '
                 'eventually he delays the return of the whole prison '
                 'detachment because of his feverish perfectionism. After the '
                 'march back to the camp, the prisoners line up for the '
                 'regulation body search before reentering the camp. Ivan '
                 'discovers that he is still carrying the piece of steel he '
                 'found, which, if discovered by the guards, could lead to '
                 'severe punishment, possibly death. He panics, momentarily, '
                 'but once again, he is lucky. He manages to smuggle the piece '
                 'of steel past the guards. Later, in return for standing in '
                 'line for one of his wealthier fellow prisoners, one who has '
                 "received a food package from home, Ivan is given the man's "
                 'evening meal ration. After dinner, Ivan is able to buy some '
                 'good tobacco in another barracks, and he is even lucky '

 'summary_text': 'Act I, which Wilder calls "Daily Life," is a re-creation of '
                 'the normal daily activities found in a small New Hampshire '
                 'town. The act opens with the appearance of the Stage '
                 'Manager, who speaks directly to the audience. He tells where '
                 'all of the main buildings of the town are located and gives '
                 "pertinent facts about Grover's Corners. Then he introduces "
                 "us to the Webbs and the Gibbses, who are two of the town's "
                 'main families. After the introduction by the Stage Manager, '
                 'the milkman and paper boy arrive and signal the official '
                 'opening of the action of the play. Then the representative '
                 'families begin to assemble for breakfast. First, the mother '
                 'in each family tries to get her children up, dressed, fed, '
                 'and off to school. After the children leave, the two mothers '
                 '(Mrs. Webb and Mrs. Gibbs) meet for a chat. The Stage '
                 'Manager returns and states more facts about the town. By '
                 'this time, the day has passed by. Emily Webb and George '
                 'Gibbs come home from school. George is struggling with '
                 'schoolwork; Emily is the best student in her class. The two '
                 'young people arrange a way so that Emily can assist George. '
                 'The Stage Manager returns and tells more about the town. '
                 'Mrs. Webb and Mrs. Gibbs attend weekly choir rehearsal. '
                 "Afterward, they discuss the organist's drinking. That night, "
                 "Mrs. Gibbs tells her husband that the organist's drinking "
                 'problem is the worst she has ever seen. The constable '
                 'strolls by on patrol. This passage signals the end of a '
                 'typical day. The second act occurs some years later. After '
                 'more comments by the Stage Manager, Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb '
                 'return to the stage to prepare for a wedding. Both receive '
                 'deliveries from the milkman and invite him and his wife to '
                 'the ceremony. George Gibbs comes downstairs and tells his '
                 'mother that he is going across the yard to see Emily, his '
                 'girl; they are to be married later that day. When he reaches '
                 "the Webbs' house, Mrs. Webb reminds him that the groom "
                 'should not see the bride on the day of the wedding. George '
                 'talks to his future father-in-law until Mrs. Webb reappears '
                 'and sends George home so that Emily can come downstairs to '
                 'breakfast. The Stage Manager then turns back time to the day '
                 'when George and Emily first discover their love for each '
                 'other. George stops Emily on their way home from school. He '
                 'has just been elected president of the senior class; Emily '
                 'is secretary-treasurer. He asks her why she is mad at him. '
                 'Emily admonishes George for immersing himself in baseball '
                 'and forgetting his friends. He assures Emily that he has not '
                 'forgotten her. George emphasizes that Emily is special to '
                 'him and that she remains in his thoughts. Emily feels that '
                 'she is mistaken about George and returns his affection. They '
                 'part after having acknowledged their mutual love. The Stage '
                 'Manager enters and explains that he will serve as minister '
                 'and makes further comments about weddings. Mrs. Webb '
                 'expresses fear about losing her daughter. Then George owns '
                 'up to momentary doubts about getting married. In the '
                 'meantime, Emily relates her qualms to her father. As soon as '
                 'George and Emily see each other, they overcome their fears. '
                 'The ceremony takes place in the background while the '
                 'audience hears the comments of Mrs. Soames, a wedding guest. '
                 'Then the Stage Manager returns in his original persona to '
                 'make closing remarks. The third act occurs in the cemetery '
                 'at the burial of Emily Webb Gibbs, who has just died in '
                 'childbirth and left her husband and four-year-old son. Like '
                 'any newcomer, she is uneasy among the dead; she wonders how '
                 'long the feeling will last. After the mourners leave the '
                 'cemetery, she longs to return to life for a single day. The '
                 'other spirits try to dissuade her, but she insists. Emily '
                 'chooses to relive her twelfth birthday, but when she returns '
                 'to earth, she discovers that people live their lives without '
                 'appreciating or sharing the moment of living. They overlook '
                 'the joy found in simple everyday activities. Emotionally '
                 'unable to endure a full day of her past, Emily returns to '
                 'the cemetery. There, at night, she watches George come to '
                 'grieve at her grave. Emily perceives that the living '
                 'understand little about death and even less about being '
                 'alive.',

{'author': 'Homer',
 'book_title': 'The Odyssey',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'After an invocation to the Muse of poetry, the epic begins '
                 'in medias res ("in the middle of things"). Odysseus has been '
                 'gone from Ithaca for about 20 years — the first 10 spent '
                 'fighting the Trojan War, the last 10 trying to get home. '
                 "Meanwhile, Odysseus' wife, Penelope, tries to fend off over "
                 '100 suitors who have invaded the royal palace, seeking her '
                 'hand in marriage (and a chance of ruling Ithaca), and '
                 "indulging in great amounts of food and wine at the hosts' "
                 'expense. Telemachus, son of Odysseus and Penelope, is just '
                 'coming of age (he is approximately 21) and is at a loss as '
                 'to what to do about the suitors. Mother and son yearn for '
                 "Odysseus' return. The first four books deal with Telemachus' "
                 'struggle (in fact, Odysseus does not appear in the epic '
                 'until Book 5). A secondary plot in The Odyssey is '
                 "Telemachus' coming of age, his own quest, which scholars "
                 'sometimes refer to as the "Telemacheia." The goddess Athena '
                 'appears to the young prince in disguise and advises him to '
                 "gather an assembly of the island's leaders to protest the "
                 'invasion of the suitors. Soon after, he is to visit King '
                 'Nestor of Pylos and King Menelaus of Sparta, old comrades of '
                 "his father's, to gather from them any new of Odysseus. At "
                 'the assembly, the two leading suitors — the aggressive '
                 'Antinous and the smooth-talking Eurymachus — confront the '
                 'prince. They accuse Penelope of delaying too long in her '
                 'choice of a new husband. Telemachus speaks well but '
                 'accomplishes little at the assembly because the suitors are '
                 'from some of the strongest families in the area and are '
                 "impatient with Penelope's delays. As Telemachus secretly "
                 'sets off for Pylos and Sparta, the suitors plot to '
                 'assassinate him. At Pylos, Telemachus learns little of his '
                 'father but is encouraged to visit Sparta where King Menelaus '
                 'reports that Odysseus is alive but held captive by the '
                 'goddess nymph Calypso. Homer leaves the story of Telemachus '
                 'as the suitors are about to ambush his ship on its return to '
                 "Ithaca. At Athena's urging, the gods have decided to free "
                 'Odysseus from Calypso. Hermes, the messenger god, delivers '
                 "the order to Odysseus' captor. Odysseus has spent seven "
                 'years with the goddess, sleeping with her at night and '
                 'pining for his home and family during the day. Calypso is a '
                 'beautiful, lustful nymph who wants to marry Odysseus and '
                 'grant him immortality, but he longs for Penelope and Ithaca. '
                 'Reluctantly, Calypso sends Odysseus on his way. Poseidon, '
                 'the sea god, spots the wayfarer and, seeking revenge because '
                 "Odysseus blinded Poseidon's son Cyclops, shipwrecks Odysseus "
                 'on Phaeacia, which is ruled by King Alcinous. The '
                 'Phaeacians, civilized and hospitable people, welcome the '
                 'stranger and encourage him to tell of his adventures. '
                 "Through Odysseus' narration, the reader goes back 10 years "
                 'and hears his tale. Known as "The Wanderings of Odysseus," '
                 'this section is the most famous of the epic. At the end of '
                 'the Trojan War, Odysseus and his men sail first to the land '
                 'of the Cicones. The Greeks succeed in raiding the central '
                 'city but linger too long and are routed by a reserve force. '
                 'Hoping to sail directly home, the flotilla instead '
                 'encounters a severe storm, brought on by Athena, that blows '
                 'them far off course to the land of the Lotus-eaters. These '
                 'are not hostile people, but eating the lotus plant removes '
                 'memory and ambition; Odysseus is barely able to pull his men '
                 'away and resume the journey. Curiosity compels Odysseus to '
                 'explore the land of the Cyclops, a race of uncivilized, '
                 'cannibalistic, one-eyed giants. One of them, Polyphemus '
                 '(also known simply as "Cyclops"), traps Odysseus\' scouting '
                 'party in his cave. To escape, Odysseus blinds the one-eyed '
                 "monster, incurring the wrath of the giant's father, "
                 'Poseidon. Aeolus, the wind god, is initially a friendly '
                 'host. He captures all adverse winds and bags them for '
                 'Odysseus, who is thus able to sail within sight of Ithaca. '
                 'Unfortunately, his men suspect that the bag holds treasure '
                 'and open it while Odysseus sleeps. The troublesome winds '
                 'blow the party back to Aeolus, who wants no more to do with '
                 'them, speculating that they must be cursed by the gods. The '
                 'next hosts, the cannibalistic Laestrygonians, sink all the '
                 "ships but Odysseus' in a surprise attack. The remaining "
                 'Greeks reach Aeaea, home of the beautiful enchantress Circe, '
                 'who turns several of them into pigs. With advice from '
                 'Hermes, Odysseus cleverly defeats Circe and becomes her '
                 'lover. She lifts the spell from his men and aids in the '
                 "group's eventual departure a year later, advising Odysseus "
                 'that he must sail to the Land of the Dead. There, he '
                 'receives various Greek heroes, a visit from his own mother, '
                 'and an important prophecy from the seer Tiresias. Odysseus '
                 'resumes his journey. Barely surviving the temptations of the '
                 "Sirens' songs and an attack by a six-headed monster named "
                 'Scylla, Odysseus and his crew arrive at the island of the '
                 'Sungod Helios. Despite severe warnings not to, the men feast '
                 "on the cattle of the Sungod during Odysseus' brief absence. "
                 'Zeus is outraged and destroys the ship as the Greeks depart, '
                 "killing all but Odysseus, who is washed ashore at Calypso's "
                 'island, where he stays until released seven years later. The '
                 'story of his adventures finished, Odysseus receives the '
                 'admiration and gifts of the Phaeacians who follow their '
                 'tradition of returning wayfaring strangers to their '
                 'homelands by sailing him to Ithaca. Meanwhile, Athena helps '
                 "Telemachus avoid the suitors' ambush and arranges for him to "
                 'meet his father at their pig farm not far from the palace. '
                 'Reunited with his son and with the assistance of Athena and '
                 'his faithful swineherd Eumaeus, Odysseus returns to his home '
                 'palace disguised as a beggar. For the time, he resists '
                 'striking back at the suitors who insult and assault him. '
                 'Penelope seems at least suspicious that he is her husband, '
                 'but it is Eurycleia, a loyal nurse who cared for Odysseus '
                 'when he was a child, who has no doubt of his identity as she '
                 'discovers an old scar on his leg when she bathes him. '
                 'Penelope arranges a contest, vowing to wed any man who can '
                 'string the great bow of Odysseus and shoot an arrow through '
                 'a dozen axes as he used to do. The suitors all fail; only '
                 'Odysseus himself can perform the feat. With deft planning '
                 'and more help from Athena, he and Telemachus and two '
                 'faithful herdsmen slaughter the suitors. Odysseus and '
                 'Penelope are reunited, as are Odysseus and his aging father, '
                 "Laertes. Athena makes peace with the suitors' vengeful "
                 'friends and families, avoiding civil war. Odysseus is home '
                 'at last.',

                 'as a center of trade and banking and for its military might. '
                 'It is in the early hours of the morning, and two men — '
                 'Roderigo, a young gentleman and former suitor of Senator '
                 "Brabantio's daughter Desdemona, and Iago, an ensign who "

                 'Desdemona appear before the Duke of Venice. Although '
                 'Brabantio accuses Othello of seducing his daughter by '
                 'witchcraft, Othello explains that he won Desdemona by '
                 'telling her his adventures, and Desdemona, called to '

                 "planting the seed of doubt about Desdemona's fidelity and "
                 'implicating Cassio as her lover. Using Roderigo, Iago '

                 'As Cassio leaves, Iago and Othello appear. Othello notices '
                 "Cassio's speedy departure, and Iago quickly seizes the "
                 'opportunity to point out that Cassio seems to be trying to '
                 'avoid the Moor. Desdemona immediately and enthusiastically '
                 'begins to beg Othello to pardon Cassio, as she promised, and '
                 'will not stop her pleading until Othello, preoccupied with '
                 'other thoughts, agrees. The moment Desdemona and Emilia '
                 'leave, however, Iago begins to plant seeds of doubt and '
                 "suspicion in Othello's mind. Othello, beset by uncertainty "
                 'and anxiety, later demands of Iago some proof that Desdemona '
                 'is unfaithful. Using a handkerchief that Desdemona later '
                 'innocently drops, Iago convinces Othello that she has been '
                 'unfaithful, and he stages a conversation with the innocent '
                 "Cassio that further hardens the Moor's heart against his "
                 "wife and her supposed lover. Convinced of his wife's "
                 'betrayal and enraged and grieving, Othello rushes into '
                 'action, making an agreement with Iago that he, Othello, will '
                 'kill Desdemona, and Iago will dispose of Cassio. Desdemona, '
                 'true to her word to Cassio, continues to plead on his '
                 'behalf, unknowingly confirming to Othello her '
                 'unfaithfulness. He accuses her of falseness, and Desdemona, '
                 'not knowing what she has done to offend, can only assure him '
                 'that she loves him. Meanwhile, the gullible Roderigo has '
                 'abandoned all hope of Desdemona, but Iago urges him to kill '
                 'Cassio and rekindle his hopes. Late that night, they attack '
                 'Cassio in the street, but it is Cassio who wounds Roderigo. '
                 'Iago rushes out and stabs Cassio in the leg. Othello, '
                 "hearing Cassio's cries for help, believes that half of the "
                 'revenge is completed and hastens to fulfil his undertaking. '
                 'Desdemona is in bed when Othello enters. He tells her to '
                 'pray a last prayer as he has no wish to kill her soul. '
                 'Realizing that he plans to murder her, Desdemona protests '
                 "her innocence of any wrongdoing. Knowing that he doesn't "
                 'believe her, she begs him to let her live just a little '
                 'longer, but he smothers her with a pillow. Emilia, '
                 "Desdemona's servant and Iago's wife, upon discovering the "
                 'ruse, raises the alarm and declares Iago a liar before '
                 "Montano and Gratiano. She explains how Desdemona's "
                 "handkerchief came into Cassio's possession, and when she "
                 'refuses to be quiet, Iago stabs her. Cassio, wounded, '
                 "confirms Emilia's story. A soldier to the last, Othello "
                 'stands on his honor. Knowing that this is the end, he asks '
                 'to be remembered as "one that loved not wisely but too '
                 'well." Then he stabs himself and falls on the bed beside his '
                 'wife, where he dies.',

                 'the Stone , begins as the Wart, an innocent and wholesome '
                 'boy living in twelfth-century England, is informed by his '
                 'adoptive father, Sir Ector, that he must begin his '
                 'education. While wandering in the Forest Sauvage after a '
                 'night of adventure with King Pellinore (who hunts for the '
                 'Questing Beast), the Wart chances upon the cottage of '
                 'Merlyn, an old magician who "lives backward" through time '
                 'and thus possesses the ability to know the future. Merlyn '
                 'informs the Wart that he will become his tutor and '
                 "accompanies him back to Sir Ector's Castle of the Forest "
                 "Sauvage. After reviewing the wizard's references, Sir Ector "
                 "hires the old magician. Kay, the Wart's older brother, "
                 "becomes jealous over the Wart's fortune, as he does "
                 "throughout the novel. Merlyn's lessons consist of "
                 'transforming the Wart into different kinds of animals. The '
                 "boy's first transformation is into a perch, and while "
                 "swimming in the castle's moat, he meets Mr. P., a ruthless "
                 'tyrant who talks to him about power. At different points in '
                 'the novel, the Wart becomes a hawk, an ant, an owl, a wild '
                 'goose, and a badger: Each animal reveals to the Wart a '
                 'different way of life, political philosophy, or attitude '
                 'toward war. Merlyn also has his pupil witness a tilting '
                 'match (or joust) between King Pellinore and Sir Grummore, '
                 'where the two men reveal their absurd need to follow the '
                 'rules of sportsmanlike combat. Feeling sorry for Kay, the '
                 'Wart asks Merlyn if he can transform his older brother into '
                 'an animal as well; the magician explains that he cannot '
                 '(since that is not what Merlyn was sent for). However, '
                 'Merlyn does tell the Wart that he and his brother should '
                 'follow a certain path into the Forest Sauvage, where they '
                 'will surely find an adventure. The boys do just that and '
                 'eventually meet Robin Wood, the famous outlaw (often called, '
                 'in error, "Robin Hood") who explains to the boys that a band '
                 'of fairies, the Oldest Ones of All led by the witch Morgan '
                 'Le Fay, have kidnapped his companion, Friar Tuck, and the '
                 "Dog Boy, one of Sir Ector's servants. The boys agree to help "
                 'Robin and his men storm the Castle Chariot (a fortress made '
                 'entirely of food) where the captives are being held. After '
                 'rescuing the men, Kay kills the griffin (a creature with an '
                 "eagle's head and wings and a lion's body) that guards the "
                 'castle. Sir Ector receives a letter from Uther Pendragon, '
                 'the King of England, informing Sir Ector that the King is '
                 'sending Sir William Twyti, his royal huntsman, to the Forest '
                 'Sauvage to kill some wild boars. Sir Ector is expected to '
                 'receive and care for Twyti and his retinue during his stay. '
                 'When Twyti arrives, Sir Ector gives a great Christmas feast '
                 'in which songs are sung and Sir Ector delivers a warm '
                 'speech. At the boar hunt, the prey is killed but Beaumont, '
                 "Twyti's favorite hound, is paralyzed from the waist down. "
                 'While Twyti holds him in his arms, Robin kills the dog to '
                 'free it from pain. King Pellinore then happens upon the '
                 'Questing Beast, which has become sick with longing for her '
                 'once-fanatic hunter, and King Pellinore vows to resume the '
                 'chase. Six years pass. Kay prepares for his impending '
                 'knighthood while the Wart continues his education. (The Wart '
                 "will become Kay's squire after he is knighted.) King "
                 'Pellinore informs Sir Ector, Sir Grummore, and Kay that '
                 'Uther Pendragon has died without an heir, and to remedy this '
                 'politically chaotic situation, a sword has appeared outside '
                 'a church in London, running through an anvil and into a '
                 'stone. The inscription on the sword\'s pommel reads, "Whoso '
                 'Pulleth Out This Sword of the Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise '
                 'King Born of All England." A tournament is announced on New '
                 "Year's Day to give all able men in England a chance to "
                 'remove the sword. Kay convinces his father that they should '
                 'attend, and he agrees. The Wart then enters, upset at '
                 "Merlyn's announcement that he will no longer be tutoring "
                 'him. Merlyn does assure the boy, however, that they will '
                 'meet again. During the tournament, Kay arrives at the '
                 'tilting fields and realizes he has forgotten his sword; He '
                 'orders the Wart to return to their inn and retrieve it. '
                 'Finding the inn locked and nobody there, the Wart searches '
                 'for a replacement. He eventually spies the sword in the '
                 'stone and, and after a short struggle and the guidance of '
                 'some animal friends, removes it, not realizing the '
                 'significance of such an action. He returns to the tournament '
                 'and tells Kay where he found the sword; Kay then lies to Sir '
                 'Ector and claims that he pulled it from the stone. When they '
                 'all go back to the stone, however, Kay admits his falsehood '
                 'and, with his father, falls prostrate before the Wart, '
                 'hailing him as King. The Wart, confused and embarrassed, '
                 'bursts into tears. Eventually, the Wart overcomes his '
                 'awkwardness with his new title and is given a great party '
                 'for his coronation. All of the characters offer him gifts. '
                 'Merlyn reappears and tells the Wart that his real father was '
                 'Uther Pendragon. He further informs the Wart that, in the '
                 'future, it will be his "glorious doom" to "take up the '
                 'burden" of his nobility. After promising to stay with the '

                 '14-year-old boy. The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis '
                 'and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which '
                 'he believes that he is an outsider. Ponyboy and his two '
                 'brothers — Darrel (Darry), who is 20, and Sodapop, who is 16 '
                 '— have recently lost their parents in an automobile '
                 "accident. Pony and Soda are allowed to stay under Darry's "
                 'guardianship as long as they all behave themselves. The boys '
                 'are greasers, a class term that refers to the young men on '
                 "the East Side, the poor side of town. The greasers' rivals "
                 'are the Socs, short for Socials, who are the "West-side rich '

                 'movie; he is stopped by a gang of Socs who proceed to beat '
                 'him up. The Socs badly injure and threaten to kill Ponyboy; '
                 'however, some of his gang happen upon the scene and run the '
                 'Socs off. This incident sets the tone for the rest of the '
                 'story, because the event tells the reader that a fight '
                 'between these two groups needs no provocation. The next '

                 'and Johnny go to a vacant lot to hang out before heading '
                 "home. They fall asleep, and when Johnny wakes Pony up it's 2 "
                 'a.m. Pony runs home, because the time is way past his '

                 "Marcia's boyfriends reappear. Pony and Johnny are "
                 'outnumbered, and the Socs grab Ponyboy and shove him face '
                 'first into the fountain, holding his head under the water. '
                 'Realizing that Ponyboy is drowning, Johnny panics, pulls his '
                 'switchblade, and kills the Soc, Bob. Ponyboy and Johnny seek '
                 'out Dally for help in running away to avoid being arrested '
                 "for Bob's murder. He gives them $50 and directions to a "
                 'hideout outside of town. The boys hop a freight train and '
                 'find the hideout where they are to wait until Dally comes '
                 'for them. Hiding in an abandoned, rural church, they feel '
                 'like real outsiders, with their greased, long hair and '
                 'general hoody appearance. They both cut their hair, and Pony '
                 'colors his for a disguise. They pass the time in the church '
                 'playing cards and reading aloud from Gone with the Wind . '
                 'Dally shows up after a week, and takes them to the Dairy '
                 'Queen in Windrixville. Thanks to Dally, the police think '

                 'the news that Cherry Valance is now being a spy for the '
                 'greasers, and helping them out against the Socs. She has '
                 'also testified that Bob was drunk the night of his death and '
                 'that she was sure that the killing had been in self-defense. '
                 'Johnny decides that he has a chance now, and announces that '
                 'he wants to turn himself in. They head back to the church '
                 'and discover that it is on fire. A school group is there, '
                 'apparently on some kind of outing, and little kids are '
                 'trapped inside. Without thinking, Pony and Johnny race '
                 'inside and rescue the kids. As they are handing the kids '
                 'outside to Dally, the burning roof collapses. Pony barely '
                 'escapes, but a piece of timber falls on Johnny, burning him '
                 'badly and breaking his back. The boys, now viewed as heroes, '
                 'are taken via ambulance back to town, where Pony reunites '
                 'with his brothers. Johnny dies of his injuries. Dally is '
                 'overcome with grief, and he robs a grocery store. He flees '
                 'the police and calls the gang from a telephone booth, asking '
                 'them to pick him up in the vacant lot and take him to a '
                 'hiding place. The police chase Dally to the lot, and as the '
                 'gang watches, Dally pulls a "black object" from his '
                 'waistband and the officers shoot him. The senselessness of '
                 'all the violent events traumatizes Pony, but he deals with '
                 'his grief and frustration by writing this book for all of '
                 'the "Dallys" in the world.',

                 'learn what to do. On his return, Creon announces that the '
                 'oracle instructs them to find the murderer of Laius, the '
                 'king who ruled Thebes before Oedipus. The discovery and '
                 'punishment of the murderer will end the plague. At once, '
                 'Oedipus sets about to solve the murder. Summoned by the '
                 'king, the blind prophet Tiresias at first refuses to speak, '
                 'but finally accuses Oedipus himself of killing Laius. '
                 'Oedipus mocks and rejects the prophet angrily, ordering him '
                 'to leave, but not before Tiresias hints darkly of an '
                 'incestuous marriage and a future of blindness, infamy, and '
                 'wandering. Oedipus attempts to gain advice from Jocasta, the '
                 'queen; she encourages him to ignore prophecies, explaining '
                 'that a prophet once told her that Laius, her husband, would '
                 'die at the hands of their son. According to Jocasta, the '
                 'prophecy did not come true because the baby died, abandoned, '
                 'and Laius himself was killed by a band of robbers at a '
                 "crossroads. Oedipus becomes distressed by Jocasta's remarks "
                 'because just before he came to Thebes he killed a man who '
                 'resembled Laius at a crossroads. To learn the truth, Oedipus '
                 'sends for the only living witness to the murder, a shepherd. '
                 'Another worry haunts Oedipus. As a young man, he learned '
                 'from an oracle that he was fated to kill his father and '
                 'marry his mother. Fear of the prophecy drove him from his '
                 'home in Corinth and brought him ultimately to Thebes. Again, '
                 'Jocasta advises him not to worry about prophecies. Oedipus '
                 'finds out from a messenger that Polybus, king of Corinth, '
                 "Oedipus' father, has died of old age. Jocasta rejoices — "
                 'surely this is proof that the prophecy Oedipus heard is '
                 'worthless. Still, Oedipus worries about fulfilling the '
                 'prophecy with his mother, Merope, a concern Jocasta '
                 'dismisses. Overhearing, the messenger offers what he '
                 'believes will be cheering news. Polybus and Merope are not '
                 "Oedipus' real parents. In fact, the messenger himself gave "
                 'Oedipus to the royal couple when a shepherd offered him an '
                 'abandoned baby from the house of Laius. Oedipus becomes '
                 'determined to track down the shepherd and learn the truth of '
                 'his birth. Suddenly terrified, Jocasta begs him to stop, and '
                 'then runs off to the palace, wild with grief. Confident that '
                 'the worst he can hear is a tale of his lowly birth, Oedipus '
                 'eagerly awaits the shepherd. At first the shepherd refuses '
                 'to speak, but under threat of death he tells what he knows — '
                 'Oedipus is actually the son of Laius and Jocasta. And so, '
                 'despite his precautions, the prophecy that Oedipus dreaded '
                 'has actually come true. Realizing that he has killed his '
                 'father and married his mother, Oedipus is agonized by his '
                 'fate. Rushing into the palace, Oedipus finds that the queen '
                 'has killed herself. Tortured, frenzied, Oedipus takes the '
                 'pins from her gown and rakes out his eyes, so that he can no '
                 'longer look upon the misery he has caused. Now blinded and '
                 'disgraced, Oedipus begs Creon to kill him, but as the play '
                 "concludes, he quietly submits to Creon's leadership, and "
                 'humbly awaits the oracle that will determine whether he will '
                 'stay in Thebes or be cast out forever.',

 'summary_text': 'For 84 days, the old fisherman Santiago has caught nothing. '
                 'Alone, impoverished, and facing his own mortality, Santiago '
                 "is now considered unlucky. So Manolin (Santiago's fishing "
                 'partner until recently and the young man Santiago has taught '
                 'since the age of five) has been constrained by his parents '
                 'to fish in another, more productive boat. Every evening, '
                 'though, when Santiago again returns empty-handed, Manolin '
                 "helps carry home the old man's equipment, keeps him company, "
                 'and brings him food. On the morning of the 85th day, '
                 'Santiago sets out before dawn on a three-day odyssey that '
                 'takes him far out to sea. In search of an epic catch, he '
                 'eventually does snag a marlin of epic proportions, enduring '
                 'tremendous hardship to land the great fish. He straps the '
                 'marlin along the length of his skiff and heads for home, '
                 'hardly believing his own victory. Within an hour, a mako '
                 'shark attacks the marlin, tearing away a great hunk of its '
                 "flesh and mutilating Santiago's prize. Santiago fights the "
                 'mako, enduring great suffering, and eventually kills it with '
                 'his harpoon, which he loses in the struggle. The great tear '
                 "in the marlin's flesh releases the fish's blood and scent "
                 'into the water, attracting packs of shovel-nosed sharks. '
                 'With whatever equipment remains on board, Santiago '
                 'repeatedly fights off the packs of these scavengers, '
                 'enduring exhaustion and great physical pain, even tearing '
                 'something in his chest. Eventually, the sharks pick the '
                 'marlin clean. Defeated, Santiago reaches shore and beaches '
                 "the skiff. Alone in the dark, he looks back at the marlin's "
                 'skeleton in the reflection from a street light and then '
                 'stumbles home to his shack, falling face down onto his cot '
                 'in exhaustion. The next morning, Manolin finds Santiago in '
                 "his hut and cries over the old man's injuries. Manolin "
                 'fetches coffee and hears from the other fisherman what he '
                 "had already seen — that the marlin's skeleton lashed to the "
                 'skiff is eighteen feet long, the greatest fish the village '
                 'has known. Manolin sits with Santiago until he awakes and '
                 'then gives the old man some coffee. The old man tells '
                 'Manolin that he was beaten. But Manolin reassures him that '
                 "the great fish didn't beat him and that they will fish "
                 "together again, that luck doesn't matter, and that the old "
                 'man still has much to teach him. That afternoon, some '
                 "tourists see the marlin's skeleton waiting to go out with "
                 'the tide and ask a waiter what it is. Trying to explain what '
                 'happened to the marlin, the waiter replies, "Eshark." But '
                 "the tourists misunderstand and assume that's what the "
                 'skeleton is. Back in his shack, with Manolin sitting beside '
                 'him, Santiago sleeps again and dreams of the young lions he '
                 'had seen along the coast of Africa when he was a young man.',

{'author': 'E. M. Forster',
 'book_title': 'A Passage to India',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'A Passage to India was divided by E. M. Forster into three '
                 'parts. The first part, "Mosque," begins with what is '
                 'essentially a description of the city of Chandrapore. The '
                 'physical separation of the city into sections, plus the '
                 'separation of earth and sky, are indicative of a separation '
                 'of deeper significance that exists between the Indian and '
                 'English sectors. This novel deals with human relationships, '
                 'and the theme that determines its plot line is introduced in '
                 'this section: "Is it possible for the Indian and the '
                 'Englishman to be friends?" To show both sides of this '
                 'question, the reader is first introduced to Dr. Aziz and his '
                 'friends. Aziz is a Moslem doctor who practices at the '
                 'government hospital in Chandrapore under the supervision of '
                 "Major Callendar. Among Aziz's friends are Hamidullah, an "
                 'Indian barrister who has lived in England; Nawab Bahadur, an '
                 'influential landowner; and Mahmoud Ali. In the opening '
                 'chapters these men are shown discussing the English '
                 'officials who govern under the British Raj in India. Among '
                 'the English faction, who also discuss the Anglo-Indian '
                 'relationship, are Mr. Turton, the Collector; Major '
                 'Callendar, the English doctor; Mr. McBryde, the police '
                 'magistrate; and Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate and the '
                 'latest official to assume duties in Chandrapore. Between '
                 'these groups, or outside them, are Cyril Fielding, the '
                 'English principal of the government school, whose allegiance '
                 'belongs to neither group; Mrs. Moore, mother of Ronny '
                 'Heaslop, who has come to India as chaperone to Miss Adela '
                 "Quested, Ronny's intended fiancee; Professor Godbole, a "
                 'Hindu who is separated from the Moslems by his religion and* '
                 'from the English by his religion and nationality; and the '
                 'English missionaries, Mr. Graysford and Mr. Sorley, who '
                 'share none of the arrogance of English officialdom as they '
                 'attempt to convert the Indians to Christianity. The story '
                 "opens with Aziz's arrival at Hamidullah's house, where he is "
                 'to spend a social evening with his friends. Their '
                 'conversation centers upon the indignities that the Indian '
                 'must suffer at the hands of the English officials and their '
                 'wives. Young Ronny Heaslop, whom they dub the "red-nosed '
                 'boy," is a particular object of ridicule. Aziz is summoned '
                 'to the house of his superior, Major Callendar. He is late in '
                 'arriving and when he arrives, he finds the major gone. Two '
                 'English women preempt his tonga and on the walk back to his '
                 'house he encounters Mrs. Moore at the mosque. The old lady '
                 'endears herself to Aziz by her innate understanding of him '
                 'and of Moslem custom; he calls her an Oriental. Later, at '
                 'the English club, Adela Quested expresses her desire to see '
                 'the "real India" and is advised by a passerby to "try seeing '
                 'Indians." To humor her Mr. Turton offers to give a "Bridge '
                 'Party," a garden party ostensibly designed to bridge the '
                 'distance between the English and the Indian, and to give '
                 'Adela and Mrs. Moore the opportunity to meet socially some '
                 "of the upper-class Indians. At Mrs. Moore's cottage that "
                 'night Ronny and his mother discuss her encounter with Aziz '
                 'at the mosque. Ronny shows his unmistakable prejudice and '
                 'Mrs. Moore is appalled at his inhumane attitude. On her way '
                 'to bed, she exhibits a sympathetic response to a wasp, one '
                 "of the least of India's creatures. On the outskirts of the "
                 'town, Mr. Sorley, the younger and more liberal of the two '
                 'English missionaries, while willing to accept that there may '
                 'well be a heaven for mammals, cannot bring himself to admit '
                 'the lowly wasp. The garden party given by the Turtons only '
                 'serves to show more clearly the division of peoples, as each '
                 'group keeps to itself. Cyril Fielding, who mingles freely '
                 'with the Indians, is impressed by the friendliness of Mrs. '
                 'Moore and Adela and invites them to tea at his home. They '
                 'are also invited for a Thursday morning visit — which never '
                 "materializes — to the home of the Bhattacharya's, a Hindu "
                 'couple. That evening, in a discussion with Ronny, Mrs. Moore '
                 'is again appalled by her son, and quotes to him from the '
                 'Bible, reminding him that God is love and expects man to '
                 'love his neighbor (though she herself has found Him less '
                 'satisfying in India than ever before). Ronny humors her, '
                 "reminding himself that she is old. At tea at Fielding's "
                 'house, Mrs. Moore and Adela visit pleasantly with Aziz and '
                 'Professor Godbole, enigmatic Hindu associate of Mr. '
                 'Fielding. The kindness of Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested '
                 'prompts Aziz to invite them on an outing to the Marabar '
                 'Caves, which they accept. Ronny Heaslop arrives at '
                 "Fielding's cottage to take his mother and Adela to a game of "
                 'polo; his discourtesy to Aziz and his arrogant demeanor '
                 'toward all Indians causes Adela and Ronny to quarrel, and '
                 'Adela tells Ronny she cannot marry him. Later the young '
                 'people go for a ride with Nawab Bahadur, and when the '
                 'automobile is involved in an accident with an unidentified '
                 'animal on a back road, they are drawn together once more and '
                 'announce their engagement. Mrs. Moore accepts the news '
                 'calmly, but when told of the accident she murmurs, "A '
                 'ghost!" Aziz, pleased with the friendship shown him by Cyril '
                 'Fielding, shows the English professor a picture of his dead '
                 'wife, a courtesy equal to inviting Fielding behind the '
                 'purdah, the highest honor an Indian can give. The next '
                 'section, "Caves," begins with a detailed description of the '
                 'Marabar Caves, the peculiar hollow caverns within the '
                 'equally curious Marabar Hills that rise from an otherwise '
                 'flat area outside the city of Chandrapore. It is to these '
                 'caves that Aziz has planned an elaborate trip for Mrs. Moore '
                 'and Adela Quested. He has also included Fielding and Godbole '
                 'in the invitation. Unfortunately, Fielding and Godbole miss '
                 'the train and Aziz is left in full charge of the expedition, '
                 'which begins with a train ride and ends with an elephant '
                 'ride to the immediate vicinity of the caves. In the first '
                 'cave Mrs. Moore is terrified by an echo and the press of the '
                 'crowd and declines to go farther. Aziz, a guide, and Adela '
                 'go on alone. Adela, pondering her engagement to Ronny, '
                 'unwisely asks Aziz if he has more than one wife. The '
                 'excitable little Indian, upset by her queries, dashes into a '
                 'cave to recover his composure. Adela wanders aimlessly into '
                 'another cave and is supposedly assaulted by someone there. '
                 'She rushes down the side of the hill, where she meets Nancy '
                 'Derek, an English companion to a maharani, who has brought '
                 'Fielding to the caves. Nancy returns the overwrought Adela '
                 'to Chandrapore. In the meantime Aziz, knowing nothing of '
                 'what has happened to Adela, entertains his other friends and '
                 'returns with them by train. At the station he is met by Mr. '
                 'Haq, the police inspector, who arrests him for assaulting '
                 'Miss Quested. Fielding alienates himself from the English by '
                 'siding with Aziz. The English rally around Adela and press '
                 'for a quick conviction. Mrs. Moore, now sunk into a state of '
                 'apathy, refuses to admit that Aziz may be guilty but also '
                 'refuses to testify in his behalf in court; Ronny arranges '
                 'passage for her to England. On the way she dies; her name, '
                 'however, becomes for a time a legend to the natives of '
                 'Chandrapore. At the trial, Adela Quested, who has been in a '
                 'state of shock since the incident at the caves, suddenly '
                 'finds her mind clear again and exonerates Aziz. Her '
                 'withdrawal of the charge against Aziz causes her to be '
                 'ostracized by the English. Fielding reluctantly offers her '
                 'the use of his cottage while he is absent on official '
                 'business, and Ronny eventually breaks their engagement. '
                 'Disillusioned by her experience in India, Adela returns to '
                 'England; and Fielding persuades Aziz to drop a damage suit '
                 'against her. Two years later the setting of the novel shifts '
                 'to the Hindu state of Mau in a section entitled "Temple." '
                 'Following the trial, Fielding had returned to England, '
                 'married, and was then sent on a tour of central India to '
                 'inspect government schools. Godbole has become the Minister '
                 'of Education at Mau, and through his influence, Aziz has '
                 'become personal physician to the Rajah of Mau. The opening '
                 'chapter of this section describes a Hindu ceremony honoring '
                 'the birth of the god Krishna. Professor Godbole directs the '
                 'temple choir and, in an ecstasy of religious fervor, dances '
                 'his joy. While in this almost trancelike state he remembers '
                 'Mrs. Moore and a wasp, associating them as he contemplates '
                 'the love of God. The biblical statement "God is Love," with '
                 'which Mrs. Moore had exhorted her son, is repeated in the '
                 'Hindu ceremony, although through an error in its printing it '
                 'becomes "God si Love." Aziz is annoyed when he discovers '
                 'that Fielding is visiting Mau in line with his official '
                 'duties. He has become thoroughly disillusioned with the '
                 'British and even with Fielding; when he learned that '
                 'Fielding had married in England, he concluded that the wife '
                 'was Adela Quested and henceforth refused to read any of '
                 "Fielding's letters. Aziz has married again and has his "
                 'children with him. Although he does not embrace Hinduism, he '
                 'is tolerant of their festivals and is finding peace and '
                 'contentment away from British domination. He has, however, '
                 'let his practice of medicine degenerate until he is little '
                 'more than a glorified medicine man. When Aziz meets Fielding '
                 'again, he learns that Stella Moore, not Adela Quested, is '
                 "Fielding's wife. Stella and her brother Ralph have "
                 'accompanied Fielding to India. Aziz forms a special '
                 'attachment for Ralph, whose bee stings he treats, because '
                 'Ralph shows many of the traits of his mother, Mrs. Moore. '
                 'The Hindu festival continues after the celebration of the '
                 'birth of the god. Fielding and Stella go out in a boat to '
                 'better observe the ceremony, as do Aziz and Ralph in another '
                 'boat. In the storm the boats collide with each other and '
                 'capsize. In the general confusion that follows, the ceremony '
                 'comes to an end and the English return to the guest house. '
                 'Aziz has confided to Ralph that the rajah has died, but the '
                 'announcement of his death is suspended until after the '
                 'festival. Hinduism affects both Stella and Ralph, but '
                 'Fielding cannot understand the effect it has on them, though '
                 'he is intrigued by it. Aziz believes that Ralph, at least, '
                 'has an Oriental mind, as Mrs. Moore had. Although Fielding '
                 'finds that the school that Professor Godbole was to '
                 'superintend has been neglected and the building turned into '
                 'a granary, he does nothing to rectify the situation. The '
                 'floods, which have kept Fielding in Mau, abate, and he and '
                 'his party make plans to leave. Before they go, Fielding and '
                 'Aziz take a final horseback ride together. Good-naturedly, '
                 'they argue about the Anglo-Indian problem. Aziz excitedly '
                 'declares that India must be united and the English driven '
                 'out. Sensing that this is the end of their association, Aziz '
                 'and Fielding attempt to pledge eternal friendship in spite '
                 'of their differences, but the path narrows and their horses '
                 'are forced apart, signifying that such a friendship is not '
                 'yet possible.',

{'author': 'James Joyce',
 'book_title': 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "The novel begins with Stephen Dedalus' first memories, when "
                 'he was about three years old. The fragmented lines are from '
                 'a childhood story and a nursery song, and are linked with '
                 'family associations, sensory perceptions, and pieces of '
                 'conversation. In this opening scene, Joyce is presenting to '
                 "us the genesis of a future artist's perception and "
                 "interpretation of the world. Moving from Stephen's infancy "
                 'to his early days at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit '
                 'boarding school for boys, Joyce focuses on three key '
                 "incidents which significantly affect Stephen's personality. "
                 'First, Stephen is pushed into an open cesspool by a bullying '
                 'classmate, and, subsequently, he develops a fever which '
                 'confines him to the school infirmary; here, he begins to '
                 'discern that he is "different," that he is an outsider. '
                 'Later, when he is probably six years old, Stephen returns '
                 'home to celebrate Christmas dinner with his family and is '
                 'invited, for the first time, to sit with the adults at the '
                 'dinner table. This extraordinarily happy occasion is marred '
                 "by a heated political argument between Stephen's old nurse, "
                 'Dante Riordan, and a dinner guest, Mr. Casey, leaving '
                 'Stephen confused about the issues of religion and politics '
                 'in the adult world. On returning to school, Stephen '
                 'accidentally breaks his glasses and is unable to complete '
                 'his classwork. He is unjustly humiliated and punished by the '
                 'cruel prefect of studies, but after receiving encouragement '
                 'from a friend, Stephen bravely (if fearfully) goes to the '
                 'rector of the school and obtains justice. The success of '
                 'this meeting instills in him a healthy self-confidence and '
                 'ennobles him, for a moment, in the eyes of his classmates. '
                 'After a brief summer vacation at his home in Blackrock, '
                 "Stephen learns that his father's financial reversals make it "
                 'impossible to return to Clongowes Wood; instead, he is '
                 'enrolled in a less prestigious Jesuit day school, Belvedere '
                 'College. Here, he develops a distinguished reputation as an '
                 'award-winning essay writer and a fine actor in his school '
                 'play. Despite these accomplishments, however, Stephen feels '
                 'increasingly alienated from his schoolmates because of his '
                 'growing religious skepticism and his deep interest in '
                 'literature and writing. This feeling of isolation is '
                 'intensified during a trip with his father to Cork, where he '
                 "learns more about his father's weaknesses. Stephen becomes "
                 'increasingly repelled by the dead-end realities of Dublin '
                 'life. Frustrated by his loss of faith in the Catholic '
                 'Church, in his family situation, and in his cultural bonds, '
                 'Stephen seeks to "appease the fierce longings of his heart." '
                 "After wandering through the city's brothel district, he "
                 'finds momentary solace with a Dublin prostitute. He is '
                 'fourteen years old, and this is his first sexual experience. '
                 'After a period of "sinful living," Stephen attends an '
                 'intense three-day spiritual retreat. During that time, he is '
                 'overwhelmed by guilt and remorse; he believes that Father '
                 'Arnall is speaking directly to him. Panicking, he seeks out '
                 'a kindly old Capuchin priest, pledges moral reform, and '
                 'rededicates himself to a life of purity and devotion. He '
                 'fills his days with fervent prayers and takes part in as '
                 "many religious services as he can. Noticing Stephen's "
                 'exceedingly pious behavior, the director of the school '
                 'arranges a meeting to encourage Stephen to consider entering '
                 'the priesthood. At first, Stephen is flattered, fascinated '
                 'by the possibilities of the clerical life, but increasingly '
                 'he is tormented by carnal desires. He finally realizes that '
                 'his "inherent sinful nature" makes it necessary for him to '
                 'reject a religious vocation. Having made this discovery '
                 'about himself, Stephen decides to enroll in the university, '
                 'where he hopes to shape his destiny as an artist. This '
                 'decision is immediately followed by a climactic "epiphany": '
                 'he sees a girl wading in the sea; to Stephen, she embodies '
                 'the attraction, the promise, and the abandon which he wishes '
                 'to experience in life. It is at this moment that Stephen '
                 'understands that he can only hope to gain this experience '
                 'through a life of artistic expression. Shortly thereafter, '
                 'Stephen begins a new life as a young man in search of his '
                 'own values and his own credo. In comparison with the other '
                 'college students, Stephen often seems anti-social and more '
                 'concerned with pursuing his own interests than supporting '
                 'the causes of others. Even Stephen himself realizes that '
                 'unlike most of his friends, he is unusually introspective. '
                 'He is not the typical devil-may-care university student; he '
                 'rejects the typical blind patriotic blather, and although he '
                 'continues to respect the Catholic faith, he no longer '
                 'believes that its tenets should govern his life. Through '
                 'conversations with friends and a dean of studies, Stephen '
                 'eventually develops his own aesthetic theory of art, based '
                 'on the philosophies of Aristotle and Aquinas. '
                 'Simultaneously, he concludes that if he is ever going to '
                 'find his artistic soul, he must sever all bonds of faith, '
                 'family, and country. He must leave Dublin and go abroad to '
                 '"forge" his soul\'s "uncreated conscience."',

{'author': 'John Milton',
 'book_title': 'Paradise Lost',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Each book of Paradise Lost is prefaced with an argument, or '
                 'summary. These arguments were written by Milton and added '
                 'because early readers had requested some sort of guide to '
                 'the poem. Several of the books also begin with a prologue. '
                 "The prologue to Book I states Milton's purpose: to tell "
                 "about the fall of man and justify God's ways to man. The "
                 'epic begins traditionally in medias res . Satan and the '
                 'other rebellious angels awake to find themselves in Hell on '
                 'a lake of fire. Satan is lying beside Beelzebub. Satan '
                 'raises himself from the lake and flies to the shore. He '
                 'calls for the other angels to do the same, and they assemble '
                 'by the lake. Satan tells them that all is not lost and tries '
                 'to inspire his followers. Led by Mammon and Mulciber, the '
                 'fallen angels build their capital and palace, Pandemonium. '
                 'The highest ranking of the angels then assemble for a '
                 'council. In the council, Satan asks what the demons think '
                 'should be the next move against God. Moloch argues for open '
                 "warfare. Belial twists Moloch's arguments, proposing that "
                 'nothing should be done. Mammon, the materialistic angel, '
                 'argues that they do the best with what they have. Finally, '
                 "Beelzebub, Satan's second in command, proposes that the "
                 'angels try to get at God through his new creation, Man. '
                 "Beelzebub's proposal, which is really Satan's proposal, is "
                 'adopted, and Satan volunteers to find the new world and new '
                 'creatures. He leaves at once, flying to the Gate of Hell. '
                 'There, he meets his children, Sin and Death. Sin opens the '
                 'gate for Satan who flies out into Chaos and Night. Sin and '
                 'Death follow him. Finally, in the distance Satan sees Earth. '
                 'God watches Satan approach Earth and predicts his success in '
                 'corrupting Man. Man has free will. But God omnisciently '
                 'knows what will happen. God adds that Man can be saved '
                 'through mercy and grace, but he must also accept the just '
                 'punishment of death, unless someone takes on death for Man. '
                 'The Son offers to become a man and suffer death in order to '
                 'overcome it. The angels rejoice. In the meantime, Satan, '
                 'sitting on the edge of the Earth, cannot see the way to Man. '
                 'Satan disguises himself as a cherub and flies to the sun to '
                 'talk with the archangel, Uriel. Uriel shows Satan the way to '
                 'Man. Looking at Earth, Satan is taken with its beauty but '
                 'quickly overcomes his sympathy to concentrate on what he '
                 'must do. He sees Adam and Eve and is entranced with their '
                 "beauty. As Satan listens to the pair, they talk about God's "
                 'one commandment that they not eat from the Tree of Knowledge '
                 'under penalty of death. Satan immediately begins to '
                 'formulate a plan. Uriel, on the sun, becomes suspicious of '
                 'the cherub whose face shows changing emotions and goes to '
                 'warn Gabriel. Gabriel says that he and his angels will '
                 'capture any interlopers in the Garden, and late that night '
                 "Ithuriel and Zephron capture Satan whispering in Eve's ear. "
                 "The two angels bring Satan before Gabriel, who, with God's "
                 'help, banishes the tempter from Earth. When Eve awakes, she '
                 'tells Adam of her troubling dream. Adam comforts her, '
                 'reminding her that they are safe if they obey God. God '
                 'decides to send the angel Raphael to warn Adam and Eve to be '
                 'wary of Satan. Raphael goes to Earth where he eats with Adam '
                 'and Eve. After the meal, Raphael tells Adam about the great '
                 'rebellion in Heaven. Raphael says that Lucifer (Satan) was '
                 'jealous of the Son and through sophistic argument got his '
                 'followers, about one third of the angels, to follow him to '
                 "the North. There, only one of Satan's followers stood up "
                 'against him — Abdiel, who returned to God. Satan attacks God '
                 'and the Heavenly Host, whose power has been limited by God. '
                 "Nonetheless, God's forces have little difficulty in "
                 'defeating the rebels. Michael splits Satan in half, which is '
                 'humiliating, but not deadly, because Satan, as an angel, '
                 'cannot die. After the first day of battle, the rebels '
                 "construct a cannon and begin the second day's battle with "
                 "some success. God's forces begin to pull up mountains and "
                 'hurl them at the rebels, burying them and their cannons. God '
                 'is amused at the presumption of the rebels but does not want '
                 'the landscape destroyed. He sends the Son forth by himself '
                 'in a chariot. The rebels are quickly herded into Hell. Next, '
                 "Raphael responds to Adam's questions about the creation of "
                 'the world. The angel explains the day-by-day creation of the '
                 'world in six days. Then, in an effort to keep the angel '
                 'engaged in conversation, Adam asks about the motions of the '
                 'heavenly bodies. Raphael explains that Adam should leave '
                 "some questions to God's wisdom. Next, Adam describes his own "
                 'creation, his introduction to Eden, and the creation of Eve. '
                 'He describes how beautiful Eve is to him and the bliss of '
                 'wedded love. Raphael gives Adam a final warning about Satan '
                 'as he leaves. Having been gone from Eden for eight days, '
                 'Satan returns, sneaking in through a fountain near the Tree '
                 'of Knowledge. He takes the form of a serpent to try to trick '
                 'Man. When Adam and Eve awake, they argue over whether they '
                 'should work together or alone. Eve finally convinces Adam to '
                 "let her work by herself. Satan, in serpent's form, "
                 'approaches Eve and, using clever but fallacious arguments, '
                 'convinces her to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. '
                 'After Eve eats, she reveals what she has done to Adam, who, '
                 'unable to bear the thought of losing Eve, eats also. Having '
                 'eaten the fruit, the two are overcome with lust and run to '
                 'the woods to make love. When they awake, they are filled '
                 'with shame and guilt. Each blames the other. In Heaven, the '
                 'angels are horrified that Man has fallen, but God assures '
                 'them that He had foreknowledge of all that would happen. He '
                 'sends the Son to Earth to pronounce judgment on the humans '
                 'and the serpent. The Son goes to Earth and makes his '
                 'judgments. He adds though, that through mercy, Adam and Eve '
                 'and all humans may eventually be able to overcome death. In '
                 'an act of pity, the Son clothes the two humans. Sin and '
                 'Death meanwhile have sensed an opportunity on Earth. They '
                 'construct a huge causeway from Hell to Earth. On their way '
                 'across, they meet Satan returning to Hell. They proceed to '
                 'Earth while Satan enters Hell in disguise. Satan appears on '
                 'his throne and announces what he has done. Expecting to hear '
                 'the applause of all the fallen angels, he instead hears only '
                 'hissing as he and all his followers are turned into snakes. '
                 'When they eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge which '
                 'appears before them, it turns to bitter ashes. On Earth, Sin '
                 'and Death see infinite opportunities. God, looking down on '
                 'the two, says eventually they will be cast into Hell and '
                 'sealed up. Adam and Eve lament, but Eve submissively asks '
                 "Adam's forgiveness. He relents, his love overcoming his "
                 'bitterness. She suggests suicide as a way to avoid the '
                 'terrible curse on the world, but Adam says they must obey '
                 'God. God sends the angel, Michael, to take Adam and Eve out '
                 'of Eden. Before doing so, Michael takes Adam to a hill and '
                 'gives the human a vision of biblical history, ending with '
                 'the birth of Jesus who will be the savior of Man. Adam '
                 'rejoices. Adam and Eve together are led out of Eden. Behind '
                 'them a flaming sword guards the entrance; ahead, they face a '
                 'new life in a new world.',

                 'expeditions. Hippolytus tells Theramenes of his intention to '
                 'search for his father. But this is not the real reason he '
                 'wishes to leave Troezen, where the court has been in '
                 'residence for some time. Neither does he desire to avoid the '
                 'persecution of his stepmother, Phaedra. His only motive is '
                 'to escape the charms of Aricia, the only survivor of the '
                 'royal family who formerly ruled Athens. He is in love with '
                 'her, and his father has forbidden her to marry. Oenone, '
                 "Phaedra's nurse, announces her mistress, but Hippolytus "
                 'wishes to avoid an unpleasant meeting, and departs. The '

                 "for death, but the sudden announcement of Theseus' death "
                 'puts a new complexion on things. Free to indulge her '
                 'passion, she gives up her suicide plan in order to arrange '
                 'an alliance with Hippolytus against Aricia, to preserve her '
                 "own son's right to the throne of Athens. Ismene, Aricia's "

                 "in the same breath reveals her suspicion of Hippolytus' "
                 'romantic feelings for Aricia. Incredulously the young girl '
                 'listens to a revelation that enchants her, since she, in '
                 'turn, has fallen in love with Hippolytus. Hippolytus soon '
                 "confirms the confidante's speculation in a tender but "
                 'awkward confession. The interview is interrupted by the '
                 "announcement of Phaedra's arrival, but not before Aricia has "
                 'timidly admitted her own feelings. Phaedra comes in with the '
                 'purported intention of pleading for her son. However, '
                 'carried away by her passion, she forgets her original '
                 "purpose and reveals her secret love. Crushed by Hippolytus' "

                 'to kill herself. As she rushes out, Theramenes comes in with '
                 'a momentous rumor: Theseus may be alive. Hippolytus decides '
                 "to investigate the rumor and to fight against Phaedra's "
                 "claim to the throne and in defense of Aricia's rights. "
                 "Phaedra's confession has had an unexpected result. In spite "
                 'of her humiliation, her hopes have been revived and she now '
                 'urges a reluctant Oenone to plead her case with Hippolytus. '
                 'However the situation changes drastically with the news of '
                 "Theseus' return. At first Phaedra, panic-stricken, again "
                 "threatens suicide, then yields to Oenone's perfidious plan "
                 'to accuse Hippolytus of attempting to seduce her. When '
                 'Theseus comes in, Phaedra departs with a cryptic hint. '
                 'Hippolytus also leaves with a lame excuse. At the beginning '
                 'of the scene, Oenone completes the slanderous accusation '
                 'against Hippolytus introduced offstage. The credulous '
                 'Theseus is completely deceived. When Hippolytus appears, '
                 "Theseus wonders indignantly at his son's innocent appearance "
                 'and greets him with immoderate accusations, culminating in a '
                 'prayer to Neptune for revenge. Hippolytus, out of filial '
                 'consideration, defends himself by pointing out his '
                 "reputation for virtue and reminding Theseus of Phaedra's "
                 'ancestry, and by confessing his love for Aricia. Theseus '
                 'rejects the last argument as a mere ploy. Meanwhile, '
                 'Phaedra, stricken by remorse, goes to see Theseus to plead '
                 'for Hippolytus. But she changes her mind when Theseus '
                 'unwittingly reveals to her that she has a successful rival. '
                 'She becomes hysterical with jealously and rage. Finally, '
                 'however, she repents and repudiates Oenone, the instigator '
                 'and agent of her treachery. Still refusing to clear his '
                 'name, Hippolytus decides to flee but before leaving, '
                 'arranges a rendezvous with Aricia so that they may wed. '
                 'Immediately after his departure Theseus abruptly appears. In '
                 'spite of her embarrassment, Aricia stands up to him and '
                 "defends Hippolytus' innocence with such conviction that the "

                 "more deeply disturbed when a servant reveals Oenone's "
                 "suicide and Phaedra's irrational behavior. Theseus, at last, "
                 "is willing to reconsider his belief in his son's guilt, but "
                 'it is too late. Theramenes comes in with the harrowing tale '

                 'Netherfield estate, the neighborhood residents are thrilled, '
                 'especially Mrs. Bennet, who hopes to marry one of her five '

                 'and friendly disposition. They are less impressed, however, '
                 "by Bingley's friend Fitzwilliam Darcy, a landowning "
                 'aristocrat who is too proud to speak to any of the locals '
                 'and whom Elizabeth Bennet overhears refusing to dance with '

                 'an attachment. Any serious relationship between the two, '
                 "however, is opposed by Bingley's sisters (who do not approve "
                 "of Jane as a wife for Bingley because of her mother's lower "
                 'status) and by Darcy (who believes that Jane is indifferent '
                 'to Bingley). Meanwhile, Darcy finds himself attracted to '
                 'Elizabeth despite his objections to her family. He is drawn '
                 'to her spirited wit and expressive eyes, and Caroline '
                 "Bingley's jealous criticisms of Elizabeth can do nothing to "
                 "lessen Darcy's admiration. As Darcy grows more interested in "
                 'Elizabeth, Elizabeth continues to despise him and is instead '
                 'attracted to George Wickham, a handsome and personable '
                 'militia officer. Wickham tells Elizabeth that his father '
                 "worked for Darcy's father and that he and Darcy grew up "
                 "together. Stating that he was favored by Darcy's father, "
                 "Wickham claims that Darcy disobeyed his father's bequest of "
                 "a clergyman's revenue to Wickham out of selfish resentment. "
                 "Wickham's tale makes Darcy appear not only proud but cruel, "
                 "and Elizabeth accepts Wickham's account without question, "
                 'disliking Darcy even more because of it. In the midst of '

                 "family is visited by Mr. Bennet's cousin, William Collins, a "
                 "clergyman who will inherit Mr. Bennet's estate when he dies "
                 'because of a legal stricture known as an entail . Full of '
                 'apologies for the entail and praises for his patroness, Lady '
                 'Catherine De Bourgh, Mr. Collins informs the Mrs. Bennet '
                 'that Lady Catherine has instructed him to marry and that he '
                 'plans to choose a wife from the Bennet daughters. He settles '
                 'on Elizabeth, but is stunned and offended when she refuses '
                 "him. He quickly turns his attention to Elizabeth's friend, "
                 'Charlotte Lucas, who wants to marry for security rather than '
                 'love, and the two are soon engaged and married. At the same '
                 'time, Jane is dismayed to find out that Bingley and the '
                 'entire Netherfield party have unexpectedly left for London. '
                 'Caroline Bingley writes to Jane that they do not intend to '
                 "return, and she predicts a match between Bingley and Darcy's "
                 'sister, Georgiana, who is also in London. Although Jane '
                 'quietly resigns herself to a life without Bingley, Elizabeth '
                 "is angry for her sister and suspects that Bingley's sisters "
                 'and Darcy are trying to keep him from Jane. Elizabeth visits '
                 'Charlotte at her new home in Hunsford, Kent, and meets Mr. '
                 "Collins' patroness and Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine De "
                 'Bourgh, an overbearing woman who thrives on meddling in '

                 'Kent, Darcy visits his aunt with his cousin, Colonel '
                 'Fitzwilliam. Darcy puzzles Elizabeth with his behavior; he '
                 'seems to seek out her company, but he never says much. One '
                 'day, he surprises Elizabeth by proposing to her. Still '
                 'repelled by his pride and believing Darcy is responsible for '
                 "Bingley's separation from Jane and for Wickham's misfortune, "
                 'Elizabeth refuses him. The next day, Darcy gives her a '
                 'letter explaining his role in influencing Bingley away from '
                 "Jane and details the facts of Wickham's situation. A careful "
                 'examination of the facts reveals that Darcy, while proud, is '
                 'innocent of wrongdoing, leaving Elizabeth mortified at her '
                 'discovery of how her own pride prejudiced her against Darcy. '
                 'After returning home for a month, Elizabeth goes on a trip '
                 'with her aunt and uncle Gardiner to Derbyshire county, where '
                 "they visit Darcy's estate of Pemberley. There they meet "
                 'Darcy unexpectedly and are all surprised at how graciously '
                 'he treats them. He calls on Elizabeth at her inn, introduces '
                 'her to his sister, and invites her to Pemberley for dinner. '
                 'Darcy is still in love with Elizabeth, and Elizabeth begins '
                 'to have similar feelings for him. In the midst of this '
                 'promising situation, Elizabeth receives two letters from '
                 'Jane telling her that Lydia has eloped with Wickham, causing '
                 'Elizabeth and the Gardiners to leave for home immediately. '
                 'Elizabeth fears that Lydia and the Bennet family are '
                 'permanently disgraced and that her newly-discovered love for '
                 'Darcy is hopeless. When Lydia is found, however, she and '
                 'Wickham marry. After the wedding, Elizabeth discovers that '
                 'Darcy was instrumental in orchestrating the marriage, '
                 'thereby saving the reputation and marriageability of the '
                 'other Bennet daughters. Bingley returns to Netherfield and '
                 'soon asks Jane to marry him. Jane, of course, accepts, and '
                 "Mrs. Bennet's exultation is only lessened by her irritation "
                 "at Darcy's occasional presence. Meanwhile, Elizabeth's "
                 'happiness for her sister is interrupted by a visit from Lady '
                 'Catherine De Bourgh, who has heard a rumor that Darcy and '
                 'Elizabeth are engaged, which they are not. She lectures '
                 'Elizabeth on the imprudence of such a match, and then '
                 'demands that Elizabeth promise not to accept any proposal '
                 'from Darcy. Elizabeth refuses, causing Lady Catherine to '
                 "tell Darcy about Elizabeth's impertinence and to scold him "
                 'about the folly of an engagement between them. Lady '
                 "Catherine's description of Elizabeth's response to her "
                 'demands gives Darcy hope that Elizabeth has had a change of '
                 'heart. He proposes again and Elizabeth happily accepts.',

                 'Pickwick, decides to establish a traveling society in which '
                 'four members journey about England and make reports on their '
                 'travels. The four members are Mr. Pickwick, a kindly retired '

                 'with the help of a lawyer, Mr. Perker, they buy off Jingle '
                 'and save Rachael Wardle from an unhappy marriage. In London '
                 'Mr. Pickwick comes across Sam Weller, a boot cleaner and '
                 'general handyman whom he takes on as a valet. Sam is a '
                 'cockney man of the world: witty, intelligent, handy with his '
                 'fists. When Mr. Pickwick tells his widowed landlady, Mrs. '
                 'Bardell, that he has taken on a servant, she assumes from '
                 'the ambiguous way he puts it that he intends to marry her. '
                 'Mrs. Bardell faints in his arms just as Tupman, Snodgrass, '
                 "and Winkle enter — a compromising circumstance. Sam Weller's "
                 'father, Tony, a coachman who had the misfortune to marry a '
                 'widow, provides a running commentary through the novel on '
                 "the dangers of matrimony. Tony's wife has taken up with a "
                 'hypocritical, alcoholic evangelist and makes life miserable '
                 'for her husband until her death. Both Tony Weller and Mr. '
                 'Pickwick are prey for widows, because Mrs. Bardell soon '
                 'starts a breach-of-promise suit against Mr. Pickwick. '
                 'Meanwhile, Mr. Pickwick and his friends go to Eatanswill to '
                 'witness an election, which is both violent and nonsensical. '
                 'Mr. Pickwick and Winkle stay with Mr. Pott, the editor of a '
                 'partisan newspaper, and Winkle unwittingly becomes involved '
                 "in Pott's domestic fights. During their visit to Eatanswill "
                 'the Pickwickians are invited to a costume party given by the '
                 'local literary lioness, Mrs. Leo Hunter, where several '
                 'varieties of silliness are exhibited. At this party Mr. '
                 'Pickwick sees Alfred Jingle, whom he pursues to a '
                 "neighboring town. Jingle's servant tells Mr. Pickwick that "
                 'Jingle has designs on a young lady at a boarding school, and '
                 'Mr. Pickwick decides to prevent the elopement. However, this '
                 "information is a ruse that leads to Mr. Pickwick's "
                 'embarrassment and an attack of rheumatism. The Pickwickians '
                 'assemble at Bury St. Edmunds, where Mr. Wardle is on a '
                 'hunting trip, and Mr. Pickwick recovers enough to go along. '
                 'There he learns that Mrs. Bardell has filed suit against him '
                 'through Dodson and Fogg, a pair of rascally lawyers. So Mr. '
                 'Pickwick returns to London to see about getting legal help. '
                 'In London, Mr. Pickwick learns that Jingle is in Ipswich and '
                 'goes there to expose him. Because of a mix-up in bedrooms at '
                 'an Ipswich Inn Mr. Pickwick is hauled before the justice, a '
                 'local henpecked tyrant called Mr. Nupkins. Nupkins is '
                 'visited frequently by Jingle, who is interested in the '
                 'daughter. Mr. Pickwick extricates himself by proving that '
                 'Jingle is an adventurer. Eventually the Pickwickians return '
                 'to the Wardle farm to celebrate Christmas and the wedding of '
                 "Mr. Wardle's daughter, Isabella. Amid festivities Snodgrass "
                 'continues his romance with Emily, and Winkle falls in love '
                 "with Arabella Allen, a friend of Mr. Wardle's daughters. On "
                 "Valentine's Day, 1831, Mr. Pickwick is tried for breach of "
                 'promise. Due to the rhetorical allegations of Serjeant '
                 'Buzfuz and to the circumstantial evidence, Mr. Pickwick is '
                 'found guilty and ordered to pay damages, which he refuses to '
                 'do. Since it is two months before Dodson and Fogg can have '
                 'him jailed, the Pickwickians make a trip to Bath. There '
                 'Winkle gets into more difficulties over a middle-aged woman '
                 'and flees to Bristol, where he learns that his sweetheart, '
                 'Arabella Allen, has been hidden by her brother. Sam Weller '
                 'and Mr. Pickwick arrive in Bristol, where they help Winkle '
                 'find Arabella in order to declare his intentions. On '
                 'returning to London, Mr. Pickwick is taken to the Fleet '
                 'Prison for debtors because he will not pay damages. In '
                 'prison he witnesses much misery, filth, and squalor and for '
                 'a brief time he is victimized by two predatory inmates. '
                 'There he finds Alfred Jingle and his servant in utter '
                 'destitution and gives them some assistance. Mr. Pickwick '
                 'tells Sam Weller to leave him, but Sam has himself jailed '
                 'for debt to be with his kindly master. Dismayed by the '
                 'misery of prison, Mr. Pickwick rents a cell by himself and '
                 'comes out only in the evenings. When Mrs. Bardell is '
                 'arrested and jailed because she cannot pay her lawyers, Mr. '
                 'Pickwick begins to soften. Further, Winkle has married '
                 'Arabella and needs Mr. Pickwick to intercede for them with '
                 'her brother and his own father. Finally Mr. Pickwick decides '
                 'to pay costs, which releases himself and Mrs. Bardell, and '
                 "he also pays Jingle's debts. Mr. Pickwick goes to Bristol to "
                 "tell Ben Allen about Arabella's marriage, and Ben adjusts to "
                 'the fact with the help of much liquor. Mr. Pickwick then '
                 "goes to Birmingham to tell Winkle's father, who appears "
                 'angry and disgusted by the news. Back in London Mr. Pickwick '
                 'pays Dodson and Fogg, sends Jingle and his servant to the '
                 'West Indies to begin afresh, and learns that Emily Wardle is '
                 'planning to elope with Snodgrass. Mr. Pickwick convinces Mr. '
                 'Wardle that Snodgrass is a worthy gentleman, and the couple '
                 "are married in Mr. Pickwick's newly purchased home. In the "
                 'meantime Sam Weller has been courting a pretty housemaid '
                 "named Mary, and under Mr. Pickwick's auspices they are "
                 'married. And, though the London Pickwick Club has been '
                 'dissolved, Samuel Pickwick lives to be godfather to many '
                 'children.',

{'author': 'John Steinbeck',
 'book_title': 'The Pearl',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "Kino, the novella's protagonist, is a young Mexican-Indian "
                 'pearl diver married to Juana; they have a baby named '
                 'Coyotito. Their lives seem rather peaceful, but their '
                 'tranquility is threatened when a scorpion bites Coyotito. '
                 'Juana tells Kino to go to town and get the doctor, but Kino '
                 'and their neighbors tell Juana that the doctor will never '
                 'come to where they live, so Juana decides to take matters '
                 'into her own hands and sets off with Coyotito to the doctor. '
                 'Kino accompanies Juana, and many members of the village '
                 "follow them to see what will happen. At the doctor's house, "
                 "the doctor's servant tells Kino and Juana that the doctor is "
                 'not at home — in truth, the doctor is home but will not help '
                 'Coyotito because Kino cannot pay the doctor as much as the '
                 'doctor wants, but also because the doctor is prejudiced '
                 "against Kino's race. Kino goes to work diving in the Gulf "
                 'for oysters from his canoe; Juana tends to Coyotito in the '
                 'canoe by applying brown seaweed to his shoulder, which is '
                 "swollen from the scorpion's bite. As Kino is collecting "
                 'oysters on the ocean bottom, he spots a larger-than-usual '
                 'oyster, collects it, and returns to the canoe. Kino does not '
                 'want to open the oyster immediately, but Juana prompts him '
                 'to open the oyster; when he does, he finds a pearl the size '
                 "of a sea gull's egg. Juana gazes at the immense pearl; she "
                 "then goes to check on Coyotito and discovers that Coyotito's "
                 'shoulder is no longer swollen. Kino is immensely happy about '
                 'both the pearl and Coyotito and yells loudly enough that he '
                 'attracts the attention of the other oyster divers, who race '
                 'toward his canoe. Before Kino reaches home with his great '
                 'pearl, the news of his discovery has already reached his '
                 'village and the town. Everyone fantasizes what he or she '
                 'would do with the wealth that the pearl represents, '
                 'including the doctor, who previously refused to help '
                 'Coyotito but now says that the baby is a patient of his. The '
                 "priest arrives at Kino and Juana's hut and tells Kino that "
                 'he needs to give thanks for finding the pearl. The doctor '
                 'visits Kino and Juana and tricks them into allowing him to '
                 'treat Coyotito even though Kino knows that Coyotito is '
                 'already cured; in fact what the doctor has done is to make '
                 'Coyotito sick so that the doctor can then cure the baby and '
                 'get paid more. Coyotito indeed does get sick, and the doctor '
                 'returns and gives the baby a different medicine that "cures" '
                 'the baby. When the doctor asks Kino for payment, Kino says '
                 'that his plan is to sell the pearl the next day. The doctor '
                 'offers to keep the pearl for Kino, and Kino refuses the '
                 'request, but the doctor tricks Kino into revealing where '
                 'Kino has hidden the pearl. That night, Kino hears someone in '
                 'the hut, draws his knife and strikes out at the figure and '
                 'draws blood, but is hit over the head with a heavy object. '
                 'Juana senses that the pearl is evil and begs Kino to throw '
                 'the pearl back into the sea, but Kino refuses, believing '
                 'still that the pearl will give them better lives than they '
                 'have. On the day that Kino is to sell the pearl, the other '
                 'divers do not go diving. Kino and Juana begin the trip to '
                 'the pearl buyers, followed by the entire village. The first '
                 'pearl buyer to whom Kino offers to sell the pearl offers '
                 'Kino a small amount of money for the pearl, saying that the '
                 'pearl is too big and no one else will buy it. He sends word '
                 'to the other pearl buyers in town to come to his office and '
                 'appraise the pearl. When the three new pearl buyers arrive '
                 "at the first's office, the three of them have already "
                 'planned together what each will offer Kino. Kino, realizing '
                 'that the pearl buyers are working together to get the pearl '
                 'for the least amount of money, says that he will go to the '
                 'capital to sell his pearl. The first pearl buyer raises his '
                 'offer to buy the pearl, but it is too late; Kino leaves. '
                 "Back in the village, Kino's neighbors discuss whether or not "
                 "Kino should have accepted the main buyer's last offer. That "
                 'night, Kino hears noises outside the hut and goes outside to '
                 'check on what is making the noise. Juana listens inside the '
                 "hut to Kino's being attacked and rushes out with a brick to "
                 'help him, but it is too late; Kino is bloodied and beaten, '
                 'and the attackers have escaped without Kino being able to '
                 'identify them. Again, like the previous night, Juana begs '
                 'Kino to throw the pearl back into the sea, but Kino again '
                 'refuses to because he envisions the pearl being sold and the '
                 "money being used to fund Coyotito's education. He resolves "
                 'to sell the pearl in the capital. Later, Juana rises in the '
                 'dark, takes the pearl from the hut, and goes to the beach. '
                 'Kino follows her and catches up with her at the beach just '
                 'as she is ready to throw the pearl into the water. He hits '
                 'her and saves the pearl from going into the water, but he is '
                 'then attacked by some figures he cannot identify. The pearl '
                 'is knocked from his hands, but he is able to stab one of his '
                 'assailants before he is knocked unconscious. Juana regains '
                 'consciousness and finds Kino lying unconscious, a dead '
                 'stranger next to him. When Kino regain consciousness, Juana '
                 'returns the pearl to him from where she found it lying '
                 'behind a rock and tells him that they must flee the village '
                 'because he has killed a man. Juana leaves to gather their '
                 'belongings; Kino goes to check on their canoe and finds that '
                 'a large hole has been smashed into its bottom. As they '
                 'approach their hut, they see it burning in flames. Taking '
                 "Coyotito, they go to Kino's brother's hut and spend the day "
                 "hiding there. Kino's brother, Juan Tomás, lets the other "
                 'villagers think that Kino and his family have run away, all '
                 'the while gathering provisions for when Kino and Juana will '
                 'flee. Kino continues to believe that the pearl is not '
                 'something evil but instead offers a more promising future '
                 'for him and his family. Kino, Juana, and Coyotito leave '
                 'their village and head toward Loreto. Kino is careful to '
                 'make sure that they leave no tracks but knows that they will '
                 "be followed because of the pearl's great value. Because they "
                 'are traveling at night, the next dawn they conceal '
                 'themselves and settle down for the day. Juana and Coyotito '
                 'fall asleep, and soon Kino does too. He is suddenly awakened '
                 'by noises, creeps out from where they are hiding, and sees '
                 'trackers who are following them. Once the trackers pass by '
                 'the hiding place, Kino and his family head toward high '
                 'mountains. When they reach the first rise of the mountains, '
                 'Kino tries to convince Juana to hide with Coyotito while he '
                 'leads the trackers away, but she refuses so they head higher '
                 'up the mountains to where Kino finds a stream. There, Kino '
                 'hides Juana and Coyotito in a small cave and makes false '
                 'tracks up the side of the mountain, hoping to mislead the '
                 'trackers; he then hides in the cave with his family. The '
                 'trackers arrive at the spring and make camp for the night. '
                 'Kino, realizing that the trackers will discover them in the '
                 'morning, vows to attack the trackers before the trackers '
                 'attack he and his family. As he moves more closely to the '
                 "trackers' campfire, one of the trackers who is keeping watch "
                 'aims his gun toward where he has heard a cry in the night '
                 'and fires his gun; Kino jumps on the tracker and kills him '
                 "with his knife. Kino grabs the dead tracker's gun and shoots "
                 'a second tracker. The third tracker scrambles away from '
                 'Kino, but Kino shoots and kills this tracker as well. He '
                 'then notices how quiet the night is. This quiet is punctured '
                 "by the sounds of Juana's crying; Coyotito has been killed by "
                 "the watcher's gunfire. Later that day late in the afternoon, "
                 'Kino and Juana walk side by side into town, with Juana '
                 'carrying a bundle that contains the dead Coyotito. People '
                 'watch in silence as the two walk silently, as in a trance. '
                 'Kino and Juana reach the beach, where Kino offers the pearl '
                 'to Juana to throw it in the sea. She refuses, telling Kino '
                 'that he should be the one. He cocks his arm and throws the '
                 'pearl as far out into the sea as he can; it sinks to the '
                 'sandy bottom among the water plants.',

                 'thick Cockney accent, and he ruins many of her flowers. '
                 'After he is gone, the mother is interested in how such a '
                 '"low" creature could know her son\'s name; she discovers '
                 'that the flower girl calls everyone either "Freddy" or '
                 '"Charlie." When an elderly gentleman comes into the shelter, '
                 'the flower girl notes his distinguished appearance and tries '
                 'to coax him to buy some flowers. This gentleman, Colonel '
                 'Pickering, refuses to buy the flowers, but he gives the girl '
                 'some money. Members of the crowd warn the girl against '
                 'taking the money because there is a man behind her taking '
                 'notes of everything she says. When the flower girl (Eliza) '
                 'loudly proclaims that "I am a good girl, I am," the '
                 'bystanders begin to protest. The note taker, it turns out, '
                 'is Professor Henry Higgins, an expert in phonetics. His '
                 "hobby is identifying everyone's accent and place of birth. "
                 'He even maintains that he could take this "ragamuffin" of a '
                 'flower girl and teach her to talk like a duchess in three '
                 'months. At this time, the elder gentleman identifies himself '
                 'as Colonel Pickering, the author of a book on Sanskrit, who '
                 'has come to meet the famous Henry Higgins, to whom he is now '
                 'talking. The two go off to discuss their mutual interest in '
                 "phonetics. The next morning at Professor Higgins' house, the "
                 "two men are discussing Higgins' experiments when the flower "
                 "girl is announced by Mrs. Pearce, Higgins' housekeeper. The "
                 'girl, Eliza Doolittle, remembers that Higgins bragged about '
                 'being able to teach her to speak like a duchess, and she has '
                 'come to take lessons so that she can get a position in a '
                 'flower shop. Pickering makes a wager with Higgins, who, in '
                 'the spirit of good sport, decides to take the bet: he orders '
                 'Mrs. Pearce to take the girl away, scrub her, and burn her '
                 "clothes. He overcomes all of Eliza's objections, and Eliza "
                 "is taken away. At this time, Eliza's father appears with the "
                 'intention of blackmailing Higgins, but he is so intimidated '
                 'by Higgins that he ends up asking for five pounds because he '
                 'is one of the "undeserving poor." Higgins is so pleased with '
                 "the old fellow's audacity and his unique view of morality "
                 'that he gives him the five pounds and is immediately rid of '
                 "him. Sometime later, Higgins brings Eliza to his mother's "
                 'house during her "receiving day." Freddy Eynsford-Hill and '
                 'his mother and sister Clara are also present. These turn out '
                 'to be the same people whom we saw under the portico in the '
                 'first act. Now, however, none of the guests recognize that '
                 'Eliza is the "ragamuffin" flower girl of that night. '
                 'Everyone is amused with the pedantic correctness of her '
                 "speech and are even more impressed with Eliza's narration of "
                 "her aunt's death, told in perfect English, but told with "
                 "lurid and shocking details. After Eliza's departure, Mrs. "
                 'Higgins points out that the girl is far from being ready to '
                 'be presented in public. Sometime later, Higgins, Pickering, '
                 'and Eliza return late in the evening. The men are delighted '
                 'with the great success they have had that day in passing off '
                 "Eliza as a great duchess at an ambassador's garden party. "
                 'They are so extremely proud that they totally ignore Eliza '
                 'and her contribution to the success of the "experiment." '
                 'Infuriated, Eliza finally throws a slipper at Higgins, only '
                 'to be informed that she is being unreasonable. Eliza is '
                 'concerned with what will happen to her now that the '
                 'experiment is over: Is she to be tossed back into the '
                 'gutter; what is her future place? Higgins cannot see that '
                 'this is a problem, and after telling her that all of the '
                 'clothes that she has been wearing belong to her, he retires '
                 'for the evening. The next day, Higgins arrives at his '
                 "mother's house completely baffled that Eliza has "
                 'disappeared. He has telephoned the police and is then '
                 'surprised to learn that Eliza is upstairs. While waiting for '
                 'Eliza, Mr. Doolittle enters and he accuses Higgins of '
                 'ruining him because Higgins told a wealthy man that '
                 "Doolittle was England's most original moralist, and, as a "
                 'result, the man left an enormous sum of money in trust for '
                 'Doolittle to lecture on moral reforms. He has thus been '
                 'forced into middle-class morality, and he and his common-law '
                 'wife are miserable. He has come to invite Eliza to his '
                 'wedding, another concession to dreadful middle-class '
                 "morality. Eliza enters and agrees to come to her father's "
                 'wedding. As they all prepare to leave, Higgins restrains '
                 'Eliza and tries to get her to return to his house. He '
                 'maintains that he treats everyone with complete equality. To '
                 'him, he makes no social distinction between the way he would '
                 'treat a flower girl or a duchess. Eliza is determined to '
                 'have respect and independence, and thus she refuses to '
                 "return to Higgins' house. Higgins then admits that he misses "
                 'her and also admires her newfound independence. He further '
                 'maintains that she should return, and the three of them will '
                 'live equally, as "three bachelors." Eliza, however, feels '
                 'otherwise, and she leaves with Mrs. Higgins to attend her '
                 "father's wedding.",

{'author': 'Oscar Wilde',
 'book_title': 'The Picture of Dorian Gray',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'In his London studio, artist Basil Hallward puts the '
                 'finishing touches on his latest portrait, that of a young '
                 'man. Although Lord Henry, who is visiting with Basil, asks '
                 "about the young man's identity, Basil declines to answer, "
                 'noting his preference for secrecy. Basil never intends to '
                 'exhibit the painting, because if he did, it would bare the '
                 'deepest feelings in his soul. However, Basil lets slip that '
                 'the subject of the portrait is Dorian Gray, who shortly '
                 'thereafter pays the two men a house call. Lord Henry '
                 'immediately begins to influence Dorian, suggesting that he '
                 'should treasure and guard his youth and beauty while he has '
                 'them, because they will soon fade. Terrified of aging, '
                 'Dorian wishes he could trade his soul to stay as young as he '
                 'looks in the portrait; a short while later, he again wishes '
                 'that he could stay young while the image in the painting '
                 'aged. The portrait thus begins to take on a life-like '
                 "existence; in fact, Basil's threat to burn the portrait is "
                 'likened to "murder" and Basil prefers the company of the '
                 'portrait to the real Dorian. Dorian falls in love with a '
                 'young actress, Sibyl Vane, a woman he barely knows. She '
                 "plays a different woman at each night's performance, earning "
                 'the label of "genius" from Dorian, who is as smitten with '
                 'her acting more than with her personality. They become '
                 'engaged, much to the surprise of Lord Henry and Basil. The '
                 'sweet, wholesome Sibyl discusses her engagement with her '
                 'family. Because her mother is indebted to the theatre '
                 'manager, Mr. Isaacs, for fifty pounds, she is against the '
                 'marriage unless Dorian is wealthy; they do not know that he '
                 "is. Sibyl's angry brother, James, is leaving for Australia, "
                 'but he vows to kill Dorian if he wrongs his sister in any '
                 'way. James also confronts his mother about gossip he has '
                 'heard — that his mother and deceased father never married, '
                 'which Mrs. Vane admits is true. Dorian attends a performance '
                 "of Sibyl's with Lord Henry and Basil, but the performance is "
                 'terrible. Sibyl tells Dorian she can no longer act, because '
                 'he has shown her a beautiful reality. Dorian is disgusted by '
                 'her poor acting, because her performances were what drew him '
                 'to her; he dismisses her and returns home. To his surprise, '
                 'the portrait shows marks of cruelty around the mouth, lines '
                 "that do not show on Dorian's face. He begins to suspect that "
                 'his wish is coming true, so he vows to be good so that both '
                 'he and the portrait can remain young. He, therefore, intends '
                 'to apologize to Sibyl the next day and makes to marry her '
                 'after all. However, he is too late: Sibyl commits suicide at '
                 'the theatre that night. Dorian first feels responsibility '
                 'for her death, but then views it both as wonderful '
                 'entertainment and a selfish act on her part. Lord Henry '
                 "tries to keep Dorian's name out of the scandal. Dorian and "
                 'Lord Henry spend the evening at the opera. The next morning, '
                 'Basil arrives and expresses concern for Dorian, given the '
                 'events of the previous day. Dorian, however, is completely '
                 'unconcerned about Sibyl or her family; he wants to talk only '
                 'of happy subjects. The next day, he covers his portrait and '
                 'moves it to the attic, to which Dorian has the only key. He '
                 'then settles in to read a yellow book sent by Lord Henry; '
                 "the book becomes Dorian's blueprint for life. Several years "
                 'pass, and Dorian lives a hedonistic life according to the '
                 'guidelines established by Lord Henry and the yellow book. '
                 'While the face in the portrait has turned ugly, Dorian '
                 'remains young, beautiful, and innocent. People talk about '
                 'Dorian\'s "madness of pleasure" and his dreadful influence '
                 'on the people around him, but that is of no consequence to '
                 'him. Finally, when he is thirty-eight years old, Dorian '
                 'shows the portrait to Basil, who begs Dorian to repent of '
                 'his sin and ask that the wish be revoked. Instead, Dorian '
                 'kills Basil and hides his body. Blackmailing his old friend '
                 "Alan Campbell, Dorian is able to dispose of Basil's body. An "
                 'hour later, Dorian attends a party, but is bored and '
                 'distracted. He then heads for an opium den and, out on the '
                 "street, meets Sibyl's younger brother, who has been waiting "
                 'for an opportunity to harm Dorian for nearly twenty years. '
                 'Dorian makes a case for mistaken identity when he claims to '
                 'have the face of a twenty-year-old and cannot be the man '
                 'James is looking for. A woman in the street reveals that '
                 'Dorian "sold himself to the devil for a pretty face," so '
                 'James again pursues Dorian. At his country estate one week '
                 'later, Dorian entertains guests but believes James in '
                 'hunting him. Dorian soon learns, however, that a man '
                 'accidentally killed in a hunting accident is James, and so '
                 'he feels safe. The novel concludes six months later. Dorian '
                 'and Lord Henry dine, and talk turns serious — Dorian talks '
                 'of Basil, and Lord Henry reflects on a sermon he heard the '
                 'previous Sunday while walking in the park. Lord Henry also '
                 "inquires about the secret of Dorian's youth, which Dorian "
                 'dismisses. Dorian then asks Lord Henry never to give the '
                 'yellow book to anyone else. That evening, while Dorian '
                 'examines the portrait, he decides to destroy it with the '
                 "knife used to murder Basil. Soon after, Dorian's servants "
                 'and a police officer find an old, ugly man lying dead on the '
                 'ground in front of a portrait of a young and innocent '
                 'Dorian.',

 'summary_text': 'In this section events are reviewed according to principal '
                 'scenes of action. Place names appear in the order in which '
                 'major incidents occur. City of Destruction The city stands '
                 'as a symbol of the entire world as it is, with all of its '
                 'sins, corruptions, and sorrows. No one living there can have '
                 'any hope of salvation. Convinced that the city is about to '
                 'be blasted by the wrath of God, Christian flees and sets out '
                 'alone on a pilgrimage which he hopes will lead him to Mount '
                 'Zion, to the Celestial City, where he can enjoy eternal life '
                 'in the happy company of God and the Heavenly Host. Slough of '
                 'Despond A swamp, a bog, a quagmire, the first obstacle in '
                 "Christian's course. Pilgrims are apt to get mired down here "
                 'by their doubts and fears. After much difficulty and with '
                 'some providential help, Christian finally manages to '
                 'flounder across the treacherous bog and is on his way again. '
                 'Village of Morality Near the village Christian meets Mr. '
                 'Worldly Wiseman, who, though not religiously inclined, is a '
                 'friendly and well-disposed person. He tells Christian that '
                 'it would be foolish of him to continue his pilgrimage, the '
                 'end of which could only be hunger, pain, and death. '
                 'Christian should be a sensible fellow and settle down in the '
                 'Village of Morality. It would be a good place to raise a '
                 'family, for living was cheap there and they would have '
                 'honest, well-behaved people as neighbors — people who lived '
                 'by the Ten Commandments. More than a little tempted by this, '
                 'Christian decides that he should at least have a look at '
                 'Morality. But along the way he is stopped by his friend '
                 'Evangelist, who berates him sharply for having listened to '
                 'anything Mr. Worldly Wiseman might have to say. If Christian '
                 'is seriously interested in saving his soul, he would be well '
                 'advised to get back as quickly as possible on the path to '
                 'the Wicket Gate which Evangelist had pointed out to him '
                 'before. Wicket Gate Arriving almost out of breath, Christian '
                 'reads the sign on the gate: "Knock and it shall be opened '
                 'unto you." He knocks a number of times before arousing the '
                 'gatekeeper, a "grave person" named Good-will, who comes out '
                 'to ask what Christian wants. After the latter has explained '
                 'his mission, he is let through the gate, which opens on the '
                 'Holy Way, a straight and narrow path leading toward the '
                 'Celestial City. Christian asks if he can now be relieved of '
                 'the heavy burden — a sack filled with his sins and woes — '
                 'that he has been carrying on his back for so long. Good-will '
                 'replies that he cannot help him, but that if all goes well, '
                 'Christian will be freed of his burden in due course. '
                 "Interpreter's House On Good-will's advice, Christian makes "
                 'his first stop at the large house of Interpreter, a '
                 'character symbolizing the Holy Spirit. Interpreter shows his '
                 'guest a number of "excellent things." These include a '
                 'portrait of the ideal pastor with the Bible in his hand and '
                 'a crown of gold on his head; a dusty parlor which is like '
                 'the human heart before it is cleansed with the Gospel; a '
                 'sinner in an iron cage, an apostate doomed to suffer the '
                 'torments of Hell through all eternity; a wall with a fire '
                 'burning against it. A figure (the Devil himself) is busily '
                 'throwing water on the fire to put it out. But he would never '
                 'succeed, Interpreter explains, because the fire represents '
                 'the divine spirit in the human heart and a figure on the far '
                 'side of the wall keeps the fire burning brightly by secretly '
                 'pouring oil on it — "the oil of Christ\'s Grace." The Cross '
                 "Beyond Interpreter's House, Christian comes to the Cross, "
                 'which stands on higher ground beside the Holy Way. Below it, '
                 'at the foot of the gentle slope, is an open sepulcher. When '
                 'Christian stops by the Cross, the burden on his back '
                 'suddenly slips from his shoulders, rolls down the slope, and '
                 'falls into the open sepulcher, to be seen no more. As '
                 'Christian stands weeping with joy, three Shining Ones '
                 '(angels) appear. They tell him all his sins are now '
                 'forgiven, give him bright new raiment to replace his old '
                 'ragged clothes, and hand him a parchment, "a Roll with a '
                 'seal upon it." For his edification and instruction, '
                 'Christian is to read the Roll as he goes along, and when he '
                 'reaches the Pearly Gates, he is to present it as his '
                 'credentials a sort of passport to Heaven, as it were. '
                 'Difficulty Hill The Holy Way beyond the Cross is fenced in '
                 'with a high wall on either side. The walls have been erected '
                 'to force all aspiring Pilgrims to enter the Holy Way in the '
                 'proper manner, through the Wicket Gate. As Christian is '
                 'passing along, two men — Formalist and Hypocrisy — climb '
                 'over the wall and drop down beside him. Christian finds '
                 'fault with this and gives the wall-jumpers a lecture on the '
                 'dangers of trying shortcuts. They have been successfully '
                 'taking shortcuts all their lives, the intruders reply, and '
                 'all will go well this time. Not too pleased with his '
                 'company, Christian proceeds with Hypocrisy and Formalist to '
                 'the foot of Difficulty Hill, where three paths join and they '
                 'must make a choice. One path goes straight ahead up the '
                 'steep slope of the hill; another goes around the base of the '
                 'hill to the right; the third, around the hill to the left. '
                 'Christian argues that the right path is the one leading '
                 'straight ahead up Difficulty Hill. Not liking the prospect '
                 'of much exertion, Formalist and Hypocrisy decide to take the '
                 'easier way on the level paths going around the hill. Both '
                 'get lost and perish. Halfway up Difficulty Hill, so steep in '
                 'places that he has to inch forward on hands and knees, '
                 'Christian comes to a pleasant arbor provided for the comfort '
                 'of weary Pilgrims. Sitting down to rest, Christian reaches '
                 'into his blouse and takes out his precious Roll. While '
                 'reading it, he drops off to sleep, being awakened when he '
                 'hears a voice saying sternly: "Go to the ant, thou sluggard; '
                 'consider her ways, and be wise." Jumping up, Christian makes '
                 'with all speed to the top of the hill, where he meets two '
                 'Pilgrims coming toward him — Timorous and Mistrust. They '
                 'have been up ahead, they say, and there are lions there. '
                 'They are giving up their pilgrimage and returning home, and '
                 'unsuccessfully try to persuade Christian to come with them. '
                 'Their report about the lions disturbs Christian, who reaches '
                 'into his blouse to get his Roll so that he may read it and '
                 'be comforted. To his consternation, the Roll is not there. '
                 'Carefully searching along the way, Christian retraces his '
                 'steps to the arbor, where, as he recalls, he had been '
                 'reading the Roll when he allowed himself to doze off in '
                 '"sinful sleep." Not finding his treasure immediately, he '
                 'sits down and weeps, considering himself utterly undone by '
                 'his carelessness in losing "his pass into the Celestial '
                 'City." When in deepest despair, he chances to see something '
                 'lying half-covered in the grass. It is his precious Roll, '
                 'which he tucks away securely in his blouse. Having offered a '
                 'prayer of thanks "to God for directing his eye to the place '
                 'where it lay," Christian wearily climbs back to the top of '
                 'Difficulty Hill. From there he sees a stately building and '
                 'as it is getting on toward dark, hastens there. Palace '
                 'Beautiful A narrow path leads off the Holy Way to the lodge '
                 'in front of Palace Beautiful. Starting up the path, '
                 'Christian sees two lions, stops, and turns around as if to '
                 'retreat. The porter at the lodge, Watchful, who has been '
                 'observing him, calls out that there is nothing to be afraid '
                 'of if one has faith. The lions are chained, one on either '
                 'side of the path, and anyone with faith can pass safely '
                 'between them if he keeps carefully to the middle of the '
                 'path, which Christian does. Arriving at the lodge, he asks '
                 'if he can get lodging for the night. The porter, Watchful, '
                 'replies that he will find out from those in charge of Palace '
                 'Beautiful. Soon, four virgins come out to the lodge, all of '
                 'them "grave and beautiful damsels": Discretion, Prudence, '
                 "Piety, and Charity. Satisfied with Christian's answers to "
                 'their questions, they invite him in, introduce him to the '
                 'rest of the family, serve him supper, and assign him to a '
                 'beautiful bedroom — Peace — for the night. Next morning, the '
                 'virgins show him the "rarities" of the place: First, the '
                 'library, filled with ancient documents dating back to the '
                 'beginning of time; next, the armory, packed with swords, '
                 'shields, helmets, breastplates, and other things sufficient '
                 'to equip all servants of the Lord, even if they were as '
                 'numerous as the stars in the sky. Leading their guest to the '
                 'roof of the palace, the virgins point to mountains in the '
                 'distance — the Delectable Mountains, which lie on the way to '
                 'the Celestial City. Before allowing Christian to depart, the '
                 'virgins give him arms and armor to protect himself during '
                 'the next stretch of his journey, which they warn will be '
                 'dangerous. Valley of Humiliation Here Christian is attacked '
                 'and almost overcome by a "foul fiend" named Apollyon — a '
                 'hideous monster with scales like a fish, wings like a '
                 'dragon, mouth like a lion, and feet like a bear; flames and '
                 'smoke belch out of a hole in his belly. Christian, after a '
                 'painful struggle, wounds the fiend with his sword and drives '
                 'him off. Valley of the Shadow of Death This is a wilderness, '
                 'a land of deserts and pits, inhabited only by yowling '
                 'hobgoblins and other dreadful creatures. The path here is '
                 'very narrow, edged on one side by a deep, water-filled ditch '
                 'in which many have drowned; on the other side, by a '
                 'treacherous bog. Walking carefully, Christian goes on and '
                 'soon finds himself close to the open mouth of Hell, the '
                 'Burning Pit, out of which comes a cloud of noxious fumes, '
                 'long fingers of fire, showers of sparks, and hideous noises. '
                 'With flames flickering all around and smoke almost choking '
                 'him, Christian manages to get through by use of '
                 '"All-prayer." Nearing the end of the valley, he hears a '
                 'shout raised by someone up ahead: "Though I walk through the '
                 'Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear none ill, for '
                 'Thou art with me." As only a Pilgrim could have raised that '
                 'cry, Christian hastens forward to see who it might be. To '
                 'his surprise and delight he finds that it is an old friend, '
                 'Faithful, one of his neighbors in the City of Destruction. '
                 'Vanity Fair Happily journeying together, exchanging stories '
                 'about their adventures and misadventures, the two Pilgrims '
                 'come to the town of Vanity Fair, through which they must '
                 'pass. Interested only in commerce and money-making, the town '
                 'holds a year-round fair at which all kinds of things are '
                 'bought and sold — "houses, lands, trades, titles, . . . '
                 'lusts, pleasures, . . . bodies, souls, silver, gold, pearls, '
                 'precious stones, and what not." Christian and Faithful '
                 'infuriate the merchandisers by turning up their noses at the '
                 'wares offered them, saying that they would buy nothing but '
                 'the Truth. Their presence and their attitude cause a hubbub '
                 'in the town, which leads the authorities to jail them for '
                 'disturbing the peace. The prisoners conduct themselves so '
                 'well that they win the sympathy of many townspeople, '
                 'producing more strife and commotion in the streets, and the '
                 'prisoners are held responsible for this, too, though they '
                 'have done nothing. It is decided to indict them on the '
                 'charge of disrupting trade, creating dissension, and '
                 'treating with contempt the customs and laws laid down for '
                 'the town by its prince, old Beelzebub himself. Brought to '
                 'trial first, Faithful is convicted and sentenced to be '
                 'executed in the manner prescribed by the presiding judge, '
                 'Lord Hate-good. The hapless Faithful is scourged, brutally '
                 'beaten, lanced with knives, stoned, and then burned to ashes '
                 'at the stake. Thus, he becomes another of the Christian '
                 'martyrs assured of enjoying eternal bliss up on high. '
                 'Doubting Castle and Giant Despair In a manner only vaguely '
                 'explained, Christian gets free and goes on his way — but not '
                 'alone, for he has been joined by Hopeful, a native of Vanity '
                 'Fair who is fleeing in search of better things. After a few '
                 'minor adventures, the two reach a sparkling stream, the '
                 'River of the Water of Life, which meanders through beautiful '
                 'meadows bright with flowers. For a time the Holy Way follows '
                 'the river bank but then veers off into rougher ground which '
                 'is hard on the sore tired feet of the travelers. Wishing '
                 'there were an easier way, they plod along until they come to '
                 'another meadow behind a high fence. Having climbed the fence '
                 'to have a look, Christian persuades Hopeful that they should '
                 'move over into By-path Meadow, where there is a soft grassy '
                 'path paralleling theirs. Moving along, they catch up with '
                 'Vain-confidence, who says that he is bound for the Celestial '
                 'City and knows the way perfectly. Night comes on, but he '
                 'continues to push ahead briskly, with Christian and Hopeful '
                 'following. Suddenly, the latter hear a frightened cry and a '
                 'loud thud. Vain-confidence has been dashed to pieces by '
                 'falling into a deep pit dug by the owner of the meadow. '
                 'Christian and Hopeful retreat, but as they can see nothing '
                 'in the dark, they decide to lie down in the meadow to pass '
                 'the night. Next morning, they are surprised and seized by '
                 'the prince of By-path Meadow, a giant named Despair. '
                 'Charging them with malicious trespassing, he hauls them to '
                 'his stronghold, Doubting Castle, and throws them into a deep '
                 'dark dungeon, where they lie for days without food or drink. '
                 'At length, Giant Despair appears, beats them almost '
                 'senseless, and advises them to take their own lives so that '
                 'he will not have to come back to finish them off himself. '
                 'When all seems hopeless, Christian suddenly brightens up, '
                 '"as one half amazed," and exclaims: "What a fool am I, thus '
                 'to lie in a stinking dungeon when I may as well walk at '
                 'liberty. I have a key in my bosom called Promise which will '
                 '(I am persuaded) open any lock in Doubting Castle." Finding '
                 'that the magic key works, the prisoners are soon out in the '
                 'open and running as fast as they can to get back onto the '
                 'Holy Way, where they erect a sign warning other Pilgrims '
                 'against being tempted by the apparent ease of traveling by '
                 'way of By-path Meadow. Delectable Mountains Christian and '
                 'Hopeful next come to the Delectable Mountains, where they '
                 'find gardens, orchards, vineyards, and fountains of water. '
                 'Four shepherds — Experience, Knowledge, Watchful, and '
                 'Sincere — come to greet them, telling them that the '
                 "mountains are the Lord's, as are the flocks of sheep grazing "
                 'there. Having been escorted around the mountains and shown '
                 'the sights there, the two Pilgrims on the eve of their '
                 'departure receive from the shepherds a paper instructing '
                 'them on what to do and what to avoid on the journey ahead. '
                 'For one thing, they should not lie down and sleep in the '
                 'Enchanted Ground, for that would be fatal. Country of Beulah '
                 'This is a happy land where the sun shines day and night, '
                 'flowers bloom continuously, and the sweet and pleasant air '
                 'is filled with bird-song. There is no lack of grain and '
                 'wine. Christian and Hopeful stop to rest and enjoy '
                 'themselves here, pleased that the Celestial City is now '
                 'within sight, which leads them to assume that the way there '
                 'is now clear. Dark River Proceeding, they are amazed when '
                 'they come to the Dark River, a wide, swift-flowing stream. '
                 'They look around for a bridge or boat on which to cross. A '
                 'Shining One appears and tells them that they must make their '
                 'way across as best they can, that fording the river is a '
                 'test of faith, that those with faith have nothing to fear. '
                 'Wading into the river, Hopeful finds firm footing, but '
                 'Christian does not He is soon floundering in water over his '
                 'head, fearing that he will be drowned, that he will never '
                 'see "the land that flows with milk and honey." Hopeful helps '
                 'Christian by holding his head above water, and the two '
                 'finally achieve the crossing. Celestial City On the far side '
                 'of the river, two Shining Ones are waiting for the Pilgrims '
                 'and take them by the arm to assist them in climbing the '
                 'steep slope to the Celestial City, which stands on a "mighty '
                 'hill . . . higher than the clouds." Coming to the gate of '
                 'the city, built all of precious stones, Christian and '
                 'Hopeful present their credentials, which are taken to the '
                 'King (God). He orders the gate to be opened, and the two '
                 'weary but elated Pilgrims go in, to find that the streets '
                 'are paved with gold and that along them walk many men with '
                 'crowns on their heads and golden harps in their hands. '
                 "Christian's wife, Christiana, misses her husband, and, "
                 'hearing how well he is doing in Heaven, regrets that she did '
                 'not go with him when he set out on his pilgrimage, as she '
                 'had been urged and invited to do. She makes up her mind to '
                 'follow him after receiving from a visitor a note from the '
                 'Lord, written "in letters of gold," inviting her to come to '
                 'the Celestial City. Though her neighbors try to dissuade '
                 'her, citing the great dangers of such a journey, Christiana '
                 'sets out from the City of Destructions with her children — '
                 'four sons — and is joined by Mercy, a comely young woman of '
                 'the town. Passing through the Slough of Despond with much '
                 'less difficulty than Christian encountered, the Pilgrim '
                 'party comes to the Wicket Gate, the entrance to the Holy '
                 'Way, the straight and narrow path leading to Mount Zion. '
                 'Christiana and the children are immediately admitted by the '
                 'gatekeeper, but Mercy is left outside. Thinking herself '
                 "abandoned, Mercy swoons. On Christiana's plea, the "
                 'gatekeeper comes out, helps Mercy to her feet, and leads the '
                 'party to a pleasant summer parlor, where the Lord soon '
                 'appears to assure Mercy that she is welcome as a Pilgrim. '
                 'Leaving the Wicket Gate, the party is still within sight of '
                 'it when the women are accosted by two villainous men who try '
                 'first to seduce them and then to rape them, which results in '
                 'a "very great scuffle," with the women crying "Murder! '
                 'murder!" Hearing this, one of those at the Wicket Gate come '
                 'running to the rescue and chases away the villains, who '
                 "escape by leaping over a wall into Satan's garden. Coming to "
                 "Interpreter's House, the party is well entertained there and "
                 'shown the sights, including some that had not been shown to '
                 'Christian. On the eve of the departure, Interpreter assigns '
                 'Great-heart, a stout and well-armed Christian soldier, to be '
                 'their conductor for the rest of the way. Surmounting '
                 'difficulty Hill with its many steep ascents, the party '
                 'approaches the land leading to Palace Beautiful. Here are '
                 'two chained lions, as Christian had found. But now there is '
                 'also a giant, one Grim, or Bloody-man, who emerges from a '
                 'cave and blocks the way. Great-hear advances, whacks off his '
                 'head, and leads the party into Palace Beautiful, which is '
                 'filled with songs of joy. Christiana and her group like it '
                 'so well here that , upon being invited, they stay a month, '
                 'enjoying much feasting and godly discourse with the palace '
                 'virgins. During their stay, Mercy is courted by a Mr. Brisk, '
                 'but he soon jilts her upon discovering that the clothes she '
                 'is always so busily making are not for sale, not to make '
                 'money, but to be given away to the poor. Obviously, she '
                 'would not make a thrifty, prudent housewife. But Mercy will '
                 'not long remain a maiden, for she is soon "given" in '
                 "marriage to Christiana's oldest son, Mathew. Descending from "
                 'Palace Beautiful into the Valley of Humiliation, where '
                 'Christian had been attacked and almost killed by the monster '
                 'Apollyon, Christiana and her party meet with no trouble '
                 'there, nor much in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, though '
                 'Great-heart has to drive away some devils and a lion there, '
                 'and has to slay another giant, one Maul, and take off his '
                 'head. Going on, the party comes upon an old man asleep under '
                 'a tree. Recognizing him as a Pilgrim by his clothes, staff, '
                 'and girdle, they awaken him. He proves to be Old Honest from '
                 'the Town of Stupidity, on his way to the Celestral City. '
                 'Joining the party, he directs them to a tavern kept by '
                 'Gaius, a "very honorable disciple." The stay of Gaius\' Inn, '
                 'lasting a month or more, is very pleasant. Gaius informs '
                 "Christiana of her husband's illustrious ancestry. His "
                 'forebears, it appears, were St. Paul, St. Peter, St. '
                 'Stephen, and many another ancient prophet, saint, and '
                 'martyr, including St. Marcus of Arethusa, who "was hanged up '
                 'in a basket in the sun for the wasps to eat." It is at '
                 'Gaius\' Inn that Mercy is "given" in marriage to '
                 "Christiana's oldest son, Mathew, and Gaius gives his "
                 'daughter Phoebe to another son, James. Here, too, '
                 'Great-heart gets himself another giant, one Slay-good. He '
                 'finds the giant rifling the pockets of a captured Pilgrim '
                 'named Feeble-mind, intending later to eat him. Great-heart '
                 "takes off the giant's head as another trophy and rescues "
                 "Feeble-mind, who joins Christiana's party. Another Pilgrim "
                 'joins her party — Mr. Right-to-halt, who is so crippled that '
                 'he has to hobble along on crutches. Coming to the town of '
                 'Vanity Fair, where Christiana and Faithful had been so '
                 'harshly treated, Faithful having been burned at the stake '
                 'there. Great-heart leads the party to the house of a friend, '
                 'Mnason, a native of the island of Cyprus. There are more '
                 "marriages here, with Mnason giving daughters to Christiana's "
                 'two unwedded sons, and Great-heart goes after another '
                 'monster, a beast having a dragon\'s body topped with "seven '
                 'heads and ten horns." Great-heart does not succeed in taking '
                 "off the monster's seven heads, but so injures him that "
                 'everybody expects him to die of his wounds. When '
                 "Christiana's party comes to By-path Meadow and Doubting "
                 'Castle, where Christian and Hopeful had been so pummeled by '
                 'Giant Despair, Great-heart suggests that it might be a good '
                 'idea if they took time off to kill the giant and demolish '
                 'his castle. They do this, taking a week to tear down the '
                 'castle, bringing back two captured Pilgrims they found in '
                 'the dungeon — Mr. Despondency and his daughter Much-afraid. '
                 'These two join the party, which now numbers sixteen, having '
                 'become so large that it has to walk in column along the '
                 'straight and narrow path. The Celestial Mountains are much '
                 'the same as they were when Christian and Hopeful visited, '
                 'except that the shepherds have built a palace there, which '
                 'seems rather incongruous. In any case, there is a palace, so '
                 'Bunyan tells us, and in its dining room a looking glass that '
                 'Mercy covets, saying that if it is denied her, she may have '
                 'a miscarriage. The shepherds happily present her with the '
                 'marvelous mirror, which held one way, shows "the Prince of '
                 'Pilgrims himself . . . the very Crown of Thorns upon his '
                 'head, . . . the holes in his hands, in his feet, and his '
                 'side." Leaving the Delectable Mountains, the Pilgrims come '
                 'upon a man standing in the road with drawn sword and his '
                 'face all bloody — Valiant-for-truth, who has just routed '
                 'three villains who attacked him. Valiant-for-truth joins the '
                 'party as it proceeds into the Enchanted Ground, where no '
                 'Pilgrim should rest and sleep if he hopes ever to wake '
                 'again. Here they find a man kneeling in the roadway, his '
                 'hands upstretched toward Heaven, praying mightily to God to '
                 'rescue him from the clutches of a Madam Bubble, who has been '
                 'persistently trying to seduce him. The prayerful man, '
                 'Stand-fast, joins the party as it goes on into the Land of '
                 'Beulah, where "the sun shineth day and night" and flowers '
                 'bloom in profusion the year round. Beulah Land, as presented '
                 'in this part of the book, is sort of a receiving station for '
                 'those Heaven-bound. Here Pilgrims wait until they are '
                 'personally summoned to come up to the Celestial City. In her '
                 'party, Christiana is the first to be summoned, then the '
                 'others in order, and all wade through the Dark River, the '
                 'River of Death, and are whisked up to the Celestial Gate in '
                 "chariots driven by angels all but Christian's four sons and "
                 'their pregnant brides who are left behind to propagate "for '
                 'the increase of the Church in that place they were for a '
                 'time."',

 'summary_text': "Isabel Archer's aunt comes to America after the death of "
                 "Isabel's father in order to take her niece to Europe. On her "
                 'arrival in England, Isabel meets her cousin Ralph, her '
                 'uncle, Mr. Touchett, and the great nobleman of the area, '
                 'Lord Warburton, who immediately falls in love with her. '
                 'After a short time, Warburton proposes to Isabel, but she '
                 'turns him down, maintaining that she cherishes her freedom '
                 'and independence too much to marry. A short time later, her '
                 'journalist friend Henrietta Stackpole arrives in England and '
                 'tells Isabel that her American suitor Caspar Goodwood has '
                 'followed Isabel to England. During a visit to London, Isabel '
                 'encounters Caspar Goodwood, who tries to convince her that '
                 'she should marry him. Again, Isabel says that she must have '
                 'time to see the world and make a few independent judgments. '
                 'She promises Goodwood that she will discuss the subject '
                 'again in two years. He leaves, promising to remain in '
                 'America for this time. While in London, Isabel hears of the '
                 'sickness of her uncle. She returns to his home, Gardencourt, '
                 'where she finds him dying. She also finds another guest, '
                 "Madame Merle, an old friend of Mrs. Touchett's. During the "
                 'long days when the house is involved with sickness, Isabel '
                 'and Madame Merle become good friends. Ralph Touchett knows '
                 'that his father plans to leave him a huge fortune, but he '
                 'also knows that he is slowly dying himself and does not need '
                 'much money. He therefore convinces his father to leave some '
                 "of his fortune to Isabel. After Mr. Touchett's death, Isabel "
                 'becomes a great heiress. She continues to travel with her '
                 "aunt and they go to Mrs. Touchett's home in Florence, Italy. "
                 'Here, Madame Merle introduces Isabel to her old friend '
                 'Gilbert Osmond. Madame Merle has already instructed Osmond '
                 'to be nice to Isabel because she thinks that Gilbert should '
                 'marry her. After some time, Isabel believes that she is in '
                 'love with Osmond. She maintains her independence by refusing '
                 'to listen to any advice. Everyone is opposed to her marrying '
                 'Osmond because all feel that he is a worthless fortune '
                 'hunter. Some years later, Isabel knows that she has made a '
                 'mistake. Gilbert Osmond, now her husband, has tried to break '
                 "Isabel's independent nature and has tried to make her obey "
                 'his every wish. He wants Isabel to be as quiet and obedient '
                 'as is his daughter. Pansy, the daughter, has been brought up '
                 'in a convent and has been taught to obey her father in '
                 'everything. Thus when the father disapproves of the young '
                 'man that Pansy is in love with, she must submit to his '
                 'wishes. When Isabel receives a letter telling her that her '
                 'cousin Ralph is dying, she wants to go to England to visit '
                 'him. Osmond opposes the trip because it would not look '
                 'proper. At this time, Isabel discovers that Pansy is '
                 'actually the illegitimate child of Madame Merle and Gilbert '
                 'Osmond. She then realizes that her friend Madame Merle '
                 'tricked her into an imprudent marriage with Osmond, and with '
                 'this knowledge Isabel leaves for England in spite of her '
                 "husband's disapproval. In England, she confesses the mistake "
                 'she made in marrying Osmond, and Caspar Goodwood pleads with '
                 'her to leave her husband. Isabel, however, feels that she '
                 'cannot forsake the sacred bonds of marriage and feels that '
                 'Pansy needs her help. She therefore decides to return to '
                 'Osmond in spite of her dislike for him.',

 'summary_text': 'In 1959, evangelical Baptist preacher Nathan Price takes his '
                 'family to the Belgian Congo as missionaries. Nathan travels '
                 'to Africa intent upon saving souls, but his wife, Orleanna, '
                 'and four daughters (Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May) are '
                 'more concerned with what supplies they should take to live '
                 'comfortably there for the next year. When they arrive in the '
                 'Congo, they are assigned to the village of Kilanga, where '
                 'the Prices will be the only American family. Soon after '
                 'their arrival, it becomes clear that they brought the wrong '
                 'types of supplies and are woefully unprepared to deal with '
                 'life in such a drastically different culture and climate. '
                 'Nathan is inflexible in his approach to both the Congolese '
                 'and his family, and Orleanna and her daughters are '
                 'overwhelmed by their changed circumstances. In time, the '
                 'Price girls begin to adjust to their new life in the Congo. '
                 'Rachel hates everything about it and simply wants to be a '
                 'normal American teenager. Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, on the '
                 'other hand, begin to appreciate the Congo. Leah, who is '
                 "Adah's twin, enjoys observing the Congolese culture, while "
                 'Adah studies the variety of plants, animals, and insects '
                 'around them. Ruth May spends her time climbing trees and '
                 'befriending the village children, to whom she teaches the '
                 'game, "Mother, May I?" Meanwhile, Nathan tries to persuade '
                 'the villagers to come to church and get baptized, and '
                 "Orleanna worries for her family's safety and health. The "
                 "stability of the Prices' mission in Kilanga is soon "
                 'challenged on both local and global fronts. One night '
                 'Anatole, the schoolteacher, comes to dinner and tells the '
                 "family that the village chief is unhappy with Nathan's "
                 'church. Rather than trying to work out a compromise with the '
                 'chief, Nathan gets angry and sends Anatole away. Around the '
                 'same time, Ruth May breaks her arm, and Nathan takes her to '
                 'a doctor in Stanleyville. While there, the doctor discusses '
                 'the possibility of the Congo gaining independence, and '
                 'Nathan scoffs at the idea. Soon after, the Underdowns '
                 '(missionaries who once served in Kilanga) tell the Prices '
                 'they need to leave the Congo due to the upcoming elections '
                 'and independence, but Nathan refuses, determined to continue '
                 'his mission. Orleanna and Ruth May become sick and are '
                 'bedridden. With their mother ill, Rachel, Leah, and Adah '
                 'must now run the house, and they soon discover just how '
                 'difficult it is. After a month of illness, Orleanna is well '
                 "enough to get around again, but Ruth May doesn't show any "
                 'signs of getting better. Orleanna begins actively searching '
                 'for ways to get her family out of the Congo. During this '
                 'time, the area enters a period of drought, compounding the '
                 'difficulties in finding food. Seeing that the Prices are '
                 'struggling to keep their family fed, Tata Ndu, the chief, '
                 'begins courting Rachel, intent on marrying her in order to '
                 'give the Prices one less mouth to feed. Although the Prices '
                 "appreciate the intention, they don't want Rachel to marry "
                 "the chief, but they also don't want to offend him. "
                 'Therefore, Nathan arranges for Rachel to pretend to be '
                 'engaged to Eeben Axelroot, a corrupt pilot who lives in the '
                 'village. Brother Fowles, the missionary who preceded the '
                 'Prices in Kilanga, visits the village one day with his '
                 'Congolese wife and children. Orleanna and her daughters are '
                 'struck by how his approach to bringing Christianity to '
                 "Africa differs from Nathan's: He has a much less restrictive "
                 'view of scripture and worship and seems to be well-liked '
                 'throughout the village. One night the Prices are awakened by '
                 'hordes of ants swarming through the village and eating '
                 'everything they can, including plants, animals, and people. '
                 'Everyone in the village flees to the river to escape the '
                 'ants. Adah, who is disabled, is upset when her mother '
                 'chooses to save Ruth May rather than her. On that night, '
                 'Leah tells Anatole, the schoolteacher — with whom she has '
                 'been spending a great deal of time — that she loves him. One '
                 'Sunday, while Nathan is preaching, Tata Ndu interrupts his '
                 'sermon to hold a vote to determine whether or not the '
                 "village will choose Jesus as the village's personal God. "
                 'Jesus loses. Meanwhile, Anatole has given Leah a bow and she '
                 'has been learning to hunt. When Tata Ndu decides to have a '
                 'huge hunt to procure some food, Anatole argues to allow Leah '
                 'to participate. The chief and elders of the village are '
                 'against a woman participating in the hunt. They hold a vote, '
                 "and Leah's cause barely wins. After the vote, someone tries "
                 'to kill Anatole by putting a poisonous snake in his bed. The '
                 'hunt takes place, and afterward Leah gets into an argument '
                 "with the chief's son regarding who killed an antelope. It is "
                 "obvious that Leah did, but the chief's son doesn't want to "
                 'admit that a woman could best him. A fight breaks out in the '
                 "village over the issue. That night, the Prices' servant, "
                 'Nelson, is afraid that someone will try to kill him. Leah '
                 'and her sisters sprinkle ashes on the ground inside and '
                 'outside of the chicken house where Nelson usually sleeps to '
                 'catch anyone who might go in there to do him harm. Nelson '
                 "sleeps at Anatole's that night. The next morning they go to "
                 'see if anyone entered the chicken house, and they find a '
                 'poisonous snake there. As the snake flees, it strikes Ruth '
                 'May and she dies. The footprints in the ashes show that the '
                 'witch doctor, who has six toes on one foot, planted the '
                 'snake. Orleanna prepares Ruth May for burial, bathing her '
                 'body and sewing a shroud. She moves the dining table outside '
                 "and places Ruth May's body on it. The village women and "
                 'children come and express their mourning by kneeling around '
                 'the body and shrieking. Rachel, Leah, and Adah are all '
                 'shocked by what has happened and can only kneel and pray. '
                 'Orleanna brings out all of the other household furniture and '
                 'goods and gives them to the village women. It begins to rain '
                 'and Nathan comes out and baptizes the village children in '
                 "the rain. The children don't understand what he's doing; "
                 'they only know that their friend is dead. Encircling her '
                 'body, they call out "Mother may I?" Orleanna takes her '
                 'daughters and leaves Kilanga in the rain without ever '
                 'looking back. On the way to Bulungu, a town several days '
                 'from Kilanga, Leah falls ill with malaria. She has to be '
                 'carried on a pallet to Bulungu. When they reach Bulungu, '
                 'Orleanna negotiates with Axelroot to fly Rachel out of the '
                 'Congo. She leaves Leah with Anatole and takes Adah on a '
                 'fruit truck to the embassy in Leopoldville to fly back to '
                 'the United States. Even when Leah is well enough to travel, '
                 'she decides to stay with Anatole. They marry and have four '
                 'sons. Anatole is imprisoned twice for supporting '
                 'revolutionary causes. They eventually move their family to '
                 'Angola, where they start an agricultural commune. Leah '
                 'learns from Brother Fowles that after many years of moving '
                 'from village to village, her father was killed at the hands '
                 'of angry villagers who blamed him for the deaths of their '
                 'children in the river. Rachel first lives in Johannesburg, '
                 'South Africa, with Axelroot and enjoys the society and '
                 'comforts there. She later marries twice and inherits a hotel '
                 'in the French Congo from her second husband. She devotes her '
                 'time and energy into running the hotel and becomes a '
                 'successful businesswoman. Adah goes to college in Atlanta '
                 'becomes a doctor. While in medical school, a neurologist '
                 'helps her to recover from her disability and learn to walk '
                 'without a limp. Later, she goes to work for the CDC, '
                 'investigating tropical diseases, and becomes well-known for '
                 'the discoveries she makes about AIDS and the Ebola virus. '
                 'Orleanna becomes active in the Civil Rights Movement. She '
                 "can never shake the guilt she feels over Ruth May's death "
                 "and feels haunted by Ruth May's spirit. In the end, however, "
                 'she finds peace when she and Adah return to Africa briefly. '
                 'As they are shopping in the market with Leah and Rachel, the '
                 'spirit of Ruth May looks on and tells her mother to forgive '
                 "herself for Ruth May's death.",

 'summary_text': 'The Prince and the Pauper tells the tale of two boys who '
                 'trade clothing one afternoon and, as a result, they trade '
                 'lives as well. After many adventures, matters are set right '
                 'again, with one of the boys resuming his rightful, royal '
                 'position and the other boy accepting a position that '
                 'recognizes his innate intelligence and good heartedness. One '
                 'of these boys is the long-awaited male heir to the throne of '
                 'England, Edward Tudor, son of Henry VIII. The other boy is '
                 'Tom Canty, the unloved son of a beggar and thief. '
                 'Coincidentally, Tom Canty and Edward Tudor were born in '
                 "London on the same day. Tom Canty's life in Offal Court, off "
                 "Pudding Lane, is a hard life in one of London's poorest "
                 'neighborhoods. He is forced by his father to go out begging '
                 'daily, and he is beaten severely if he returns empty-handed. '
                 'Father Andrew, however, provides him some respite from this '
                 'life by telling him tales about the nobility, while '
                 'instructing him in morality, reading, writing, and Latin. '
                 'Treasuring these tales, which tell of a considerably better '
                 'life, Tom Canty imaginatively relives them in his daydreams. '
                 "One day, Tom's daydreaming leads him out of the city of "
                 'London, past the palaces of the rich, and finally to '
                 'Westminster, where he actually sees Edward Tudor at play on '
                 'the other side of a fence. Simultaneously, the prince '
                 'notices Tom when he sees a soldier roughly pulling the young '
                 'boy away from the fence; the prince rebukes the soldier and '
                 'invites Tom into the palace. Each of the boys is fascinated '
                 "by the other's life — Tom, by the luxury and the cleanliness "
                 'that Edward has, and Edward, by the freedom that Tom has. To '
                 'get a "feeling" of the other\'s life, they exchange clothing '
                 'and discover that they look very much alike. When the prince '
                 "discovers a bruise on Tom's hand, he rushes out of the "
                 'palace, paying no heed to the way he is dressed, to rebuke '
                 'the guard. The guard, believing that the prince is the '
                 'pauper, immediately puts him out of the gates, and thus the '
                 'stage is set for Edward Tudor to experience the life of a '
                 'commoner and for Tom Canty to live the life of a real-life '
                 'prince. Imperiously and angrily proclaiming that he is the '
                 'Prince of Wales, Edward is mocked by the crowd around the '
                 'royal gate, beaten, and has several dogs set upon him; all '
                 'the while asserting that he is the son of the king. Chased '
                 'back into London, Edward wanders around, not knowing where '
                 "to go until he is finally collared by John Canty, Tom's "
                 'father, and dragged off to Offal Court. In the meantime, '
                 "young Tom Canty has been left in the prince's royal "
                 'apartment in the palace. At first, he enjoys the luxury of '
                 'his surroundings, but he becomes increasingly apprehensive '
                 'about what will happen to him if he is discovered in the '
                 "prince's clothing. The Lady Jane Grey talks with him and "
                 "becomes very confused about Tom's behavior; word quickly "
                 'spreads that the prince is mad. Every time that Tom tries to '
                 'say something to dispel this idea, it makes those around him '
                 'only more convinced that the prince has indeed gone mad. '
                 'After talking with his "son," Henry VIII gives orders: '
                 'first, he commands that the Duke of Norfolk be killed so '
                 'that the prince can be immediately named heir apparent with '
                 'no opposition. Second, he orders that all persons in the '
                 "court say nothing about the prince's madness and that they "
                 'ignore any indications of it. Finally, he orders his "son" '
                 'to say no more about living in Offal Court and to try to '
                 'regain his mental health. To this end, the Lord St. John and '
                 'the Lord Hertford are to be his companions, to watch over '
                 'him, and to remind him of what he is to do. The first '
                 'ceremony that Tom must undergo is dinner. Although he '
                 'blunders frequently, his behavior is overlooked. Afterward, '
                 'he finds a book dealing with the etiquette of the English '
                 'court, and he begins the process of learning to cope in his '
                 'new position. His next ordeal is a city dinner in London, '
                 'toward which he and his entourage move in great splendor '
                 'along the Thames River. The scene then shifts momentarily to '
                 'the Prince of Wales, who is now in the clutches of John '
                 'Canty. He is brought to the filthy room where the Cantys '
                 'live and is put on display to show the neighborhood his mad '
                 'delusion that he is the Prince of Wales; later, he is beaten '
                 'because he brought no money home. Late that night, the '
                 'Cantys are awakened by someone who has come to tell them '
                 'that the man whom John Canty struck with his cudgel, while '
                 'bringing his "son" home, has died. They all leave '
                 'immediately, Canty keeping the prince in tow. The prince, '
                 'however, manages to slip away from old Canty. While Tom '
                 'dines with the nobility and watches the pageantry of the '
                 'dinner, the real prince stands outside the Guildhall, trying '
                 'to get in, asserting that he is the true Prince of Wales. '
                 'The mob jeers at him and would have thoroughly beaten him if '
                 'Miles Hendon had not suddenly appeared and protected him. '
                 'While the prince and Hendon are struggling with the crowd '
                 'outside, and while the nobility is having a merry time '
                 'inside the Guildhall, a messenger brings the news that Henry '
                 'VIII is dead. Tom Canty is thus suddenly elevated from '
                 'prince to king, and his first act is to free the Duke of '
                 'Norfolk. Hendon, meanwhile, leads the prince through the '
                 'crowd toward his lodgings in an inn on London Bridge, then a '
                 'city unto itself. John Canty, however, intercepts them and '
                 'tries to take the prince, whom he still believes to be his '
                 "son, but Hendon sends him away. In Hendon's rooms, the "
                 'prince acts out his accustomed role and expects Hendon to '
                 'serve him; Hendon does so, without a protest. As a reward '
                 'for his help and kindness, Hendon is granted the right to '
                 'sit in the presence of the king and is made a knight. In the '
                 'morning, Hendon leaves while the prince is still sleeping '
                 'and goes out to buy new clothes for the boy. When he '
                 'returns, however, the prince is gone, lured away by a boy '
                 'who is later joined by a ruffian as they head toward '
                 'Southwark. Although Hendon tries to follow, he loses the '
                 'trail. That same morning, Tom Canty is awakened, dressed, '
                 'and fed; then the Lord Hertford takes him into the throne '
                 'room, where he must sit through many tedious reports on '
                 'affairs of state. Although Tom is learning to handle such '
                 'situations, the Lord Hertford prevents him from making '
                 'several blunders. In the afternoon, Tom makes good use of an '
                 'interview with Humphrey Marlow, his "whipping-boy," to learn '
                 'many of the things he needs to know; from this point on, Tom '
                 'uses every opportunity to learn, and to remember, important '
                 'royal matters. The next two days are similar to the first, '
                 'and Tom becomes more accustomed to what he must do. On the '
                 "fourth day, however, the noise of a mob diverts Tom's "
                 'attention. Looking out the window, he asks what the cause of '
                 'this is and, after hearing about the trouble, he has the '
                 'three condemned people brought before him. Questioning them '
                 'shrewdly and disposing of their sentences decisively, he '
                 'gains the admiration of all those present; his court also '
                 'begins to wonder about the so-called rumors of his madness. '
                 'With the new confidence that his actions have given him, Tom '
                 'eats the state dinner, before all those who care to watch, '
                 'without qualm, and without error. The prince, in the '
                 'meantime, is lured into an old country barn by John Canty '
                 'and Hugo, his accomplice. He falls asleep on a pile of '
                 'straw, and when he awakens, he hears many tales of injustice '
                 'at the hands of the law. Outraged, he declares such laws '
                 'should be abolished. This, as well as his assertion that he '
                 'is the King of England, earns him the mockery of the troop '
                 'of vagabonds who have joined Canty and Hugo. Forced to '
                 'travel with these vagabonds, the prince nevertheless refuses '
                 'to take part in their escapades, and he finally manages to '
                 "escape from Hugo's custody when he tells a man that Hugo is "
                 'a thief. He then wanders alone across the countryside, '
                 'driven away whenever he begs for food or rest, until at last '
                 'he finds an empty barn. Sleeping that night next to a calf, '
                 'the prince is awakened by two young children who believe his '
                 'story about his royal claim and take him to their mother. '
                 'The woman feeds him and sets him to doing a variety of '
                 'household tasks. As he is working, however, he sees Canty '
                 'and Hugo arriving in front of the house, so he runs off '
                 'toward the woods. There, he makes his way until he reaches a '
                 "hermit's hut. The hermit, who is genuinely mad, feeds the "
                 'boy and cares for him, but when he hears that the boy is the '
                 'King of England, son of Henry VIII, he becomes consumed with '
                 'revenge; he ties up the prince and is about to plunge a '
                 'knife into him when Miles Hendon arrives at the door. The '
                 'hermit manages to lead Hendon away, but, inadvertently, his '
                 'absence allows John Canty and Hugo to take the prince with '
                 'them. Once again, Hugo tries to make the Prince Participate '
                 'in begging and thieving; the prince however, steadfastly '
                 'refuses to have anything to do with such activities. Hugo '
                 'therefore decides to put the prince into the hands of the '
                 'law, which he accomplishes by snatching a bundle, thrusting '
                 "it into the prince's arms, and dashing away. The appearance "
                 'of guilt is enough for the crowd that gathers, and the '
                 'burliest of them is about to beat the prince when Miles '
                 'Hendon once again appears. To appease the crowd, Miles and '
                 'the prince must go before the magistrate. The judge is '
                 'kindly, and the sentence is short. Hendon then manages to '
                 'convince the sheriff that the wisest course would be to free '
                 'the boy, and the two leave, headed toward Hendon Hall, from '
                 'which Miles has been absent for some ten years. When they '
                 "arrive there, Miles's brother Hugh and the Lady Edith, who "
                 'once loved Miles, deny that Miles is still alive. In fact, '
                 'Hugh Hendon has Miles arrested as an impostor, and the '
                 'prince is taken to jail along with him. There, the prince '
                 "discovers the filthy conditions of his country's prisons, "
                 'and he hears more stories about the many injustices of '
                 'English laws. Finally, Miles is sentenced to sit two hours '
                 'in the pillory; he also takes twelve lashes because the '
                 'prince once again tries to assert himself. When the two are '
                 'released at last, they turn back toward London. '
                 'Coincidentally, as the prince is returning to London, Tom '
                 'Canty is rapidly learning to be a king and is preparing for '
                 'his coronation. On Coronation Day, he rides in a grand '
                 'procession through London. Riding past Offal Court, he sees '
                 'his mother, and he denies knowing her; immediately, however, '
                 'he is stricken with remorse. The ceremony begins; then, '
                 'suddenly, just as the Archbishop of Canterbury is about to '
                 "place the crown on Tom's head, the real prince steps forward "
                 "and forbids it. Tom affirms the boy's claim. Several "
                 'inconclusive tests are tried in order to determine the '
                 'identity of the boys, and finally the location of the Great '
                 'Seal of England is suggested. With some prompting from Tom, '
                 'Edward Tudor tells the Lord St. John where the seal is to be '
                 'found, thus establishing his true right to the throne of '
                 'England. When Miles Hendon, who has been separated from the '
                 'prince, appears outside Westminster, he is arrested and '
                 'brought before the newly crowned king. Having believed '
                 'throughout their travels together that the boy was mad, '
                 'Hendon cannot believe that his young friend, now on the '
                 'throne, is the same person. To test him, he pulls up a chair '
                 "and sits in his presence; Edward affirms Miles's right to do "
                 'so, and he also affirms that he has made Hendon a knight and '
                 'that, furthermore, Hendon is now a peer of England, Earl of '
                 'Kent. Later, Tom Canty is made the "King\'s Ward," and his '
                 "sisters and his mother are granted lifetime care at Christ's "
                 'Hospital. The last chapter ties up loose ends of the plot: '
                 'Hugh Hendon, though not prosecuted, leaves England and goes '
                 'to the Continent; the Lady Edith marries Miles; Edward amply '
                 'rewards those who were land to him, punishes those who were '
                 'not, and makes reparations to those who suffered from the '
                 'cruel injustice of English laws. Throughout his short life '
                 'and reign, Edward Tudor always remembers his adventures and '
                 'reigns more mercifully because of them.',

{'author': 'Daniel Defoe',
 'book_title': 'Robinson Crusoe',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'He was rescued by a Portuguese ship and started a new '
                 'adventure. He landed in Brazil, and, after some time, he '
                 'became the owner of a sugar plantation. Hoping to increase '
                 'his wealth by buying slaves, he aligned himself with other '
                 'planters and undertook a trip to Africa in order to bring '
                 'back a shipload of slaves. After surviving a storm, Crusoe '
                 'and the others were shipwrecked. He was thrown upon shore '
                 'only to discover that he was the sole survivor of the wreck. '
                 'Crusoe made immediate plans for food, and then shelter, to '
                 'protect himself from wild animals. He brought as many things '
                 'as possible from the wrecked ship, things that would be '
                 'useful later to him. In addition, he began to develop '
                 'talents that he had never used in order to provide himself '
                 'with necessities. Cut off from the company of men, he began '
                 'to communicate with God, thus beginning the first part of '
                 'his religious conversion. To keep his sanity and to '
                 'entertain himself, he began a journal. In the journal, he '
                 'recorded every task that he performed each day since he had '
                 'been marooned. As time passed, Crusoe became a skilled '
                 'craftsman, able to construct many useful things, and thus '
                 'furnished himself with diverse comforts. He also learned '
                 'about farming, as a result of some seeds which he brought '
                 'with him. An illness prompted some prophetic dreams, and '
                 'Crusoe began to reappraise his duty to God. Crusoe explored '
                 'his island and discovered another part of the island much '
                 'richer and more fertile, and he built a summer home there. '
                 'One of the first tasks he undertook was to build himself a '
                 'canoe in case an escape became possible, but the canoe was '
                 'too heavy to get to the water. He then constructed a small '
                 'boat and journeyed around the island. Crusoe reflected on '
                 'his earlier, wicked life, disobeying his parents, and '
                 'wondered if it might be related to his isolation on this '
                 'island. After spending about fifteen years on the island, '
                 "Crusoe found a man's naked footprint, and he was sorely "
                 'beset by apprehensions, which kept him awake many nights. He '
                 'considered many possibilities to account for the footprint '
                 'and he began to take extra precautions against a possible '
                 'intruder. Sometime later, Crusoe was horrified to find human '
                 'bones scattered about the shore, evidently the remains of a '
                 'savage feast. He was plagued again with new fears. He '
                 'explored the nature of cannibalism and debated his right to '
                 'interfere with the customs of another race. Crusoe was '
                 'cautious for several years, but encountered nothing more to '
                 'alarm him. He found a cave, which he used as a storage room, '
                 'and in December of the same year, he spied cannibals sitting '
                 'around a campfire. He did not see them again for quite some '
                 'time. Later, Crusoe saw a ship in distress, but everyone was '
                 'already drowned on the ship and Crusoe remained '
                 'companionless. However, he was able to take many provisions '
                 'from this newly wrecked ship. Sometime later, cannibals '
                 'landed on the island and a victim escaped. Crusoe saved his '
                 'life, named him Friday, and taught him English. Friday soon '
                 "became Crusoe's humble and devoted slave. Crusoe and Friday "
                 'made plans to leave the island and, accordingly, they built '
                 "another boat. Crusoe also undertook Friday's religious "
                 'education, converting the savage into a Protestant. Their '
                 'voyage was postponed due to the return of the savages. This '
                 'time it was necessary to attack the cannibals in order to '
                 'save two prisoners since one was a white man. The white man '
                 "was a Spaniard and the other was Friday's father. Later the "
                 'four of them planned a voyage to the mainland to rescue '
                 'sixteen compatriots of the Spaniard. First, however, they '
                 'built up their food supply to assure enough food for the '
                 'extra people. Crusoe and Friday agreed to wait on the island '
                 "while the Spaniard and Friday's father brought back the "
                 'other men. A week later, they spied a ship but they quickly '
                 'learned that there had been a mutiny on board. By devious '
                 'means, Crusoe and Friday rescued the captain and two other '
                 'men, and after much scheming, regained control of the ship. '
                 'The grateful captain gave Crusoe many gifts and took him and '
                 'Friday back to England. Some of the rebel crewmen were left '
                 'marooned on the island. Crusoe returned to England and found '
                 'that in his absence he had become a wealthy man. After going '
                 'to Lisbon to handle some of his affairs, Crusoe began an '
                 'overland journey back to England. Crusoe and his company '
                 'encountered many hardships in crossing the mountains, but '

 'book_title': 'Romeo and Juliet',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'As the play begins, a long-standing feud between the '
                 'Montague and Capulet families continues to disrupt the peace '
                 'of Verona, a city in northern Italy. A brawl between the '
                 'servants of the feuding households prompts the Prince to '
                 'threaten both sides to keep the peace on pain of death. '
                 'Benvolio advises his lovesick friend Romeo , (son of '
                 'Montague), to abandon his unrequited love for Rosaline and '
                 'seek another. That night, Capulet holds a masked ball to '
                 'encourage a courtship between his daughter, Juliet , and '
                 'Paris, a relative of the Prince. Concealing their identities '
                 'behind masks, Romeo and Benvolio go to the ball, where Romeo '
                 'and Juliet fall in love at first sight, but at the end of '
                 'the evening discover their identities as members of the '
                 'opposed families. On his way home from the feast, Romeo '
                 "climbs into Capulet's orchard to glimpse Juliet again. "
                 'Juliet appears at her balcony, and the couple exchange vows '
                 'of love, agreeing to marry the next day. Romeo asks Friar '
                 'Laurence to perform the marriage ceremony. Though initially '
                 'reluctant, he finally agrees, hoping to reconcile the '
                 'families, and marries Romeo and Juliet that afternoon. '
                 "Meanwhile, Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, sends Romeo a challenge "
                 'to a duel. Romeo refuses to fight when Tybalt confronts him '
                 "because they're now related. However, Mercutio , Romeo's "
                 'quick-tempered friend, intervenes and accepts the challenge. '
                 'Romeo tries to part the other two as they fight, but '
                 "Mercutio is fatally wounded under Romeo's arm. To avenge "
                 "Mercutio's death, Romeo kills Tybalt and then flees. The "
                 "Prince announces Romeo's banishment for Tybalt's murder. "
                 "Romeo, in hiding at the Friar's cell, becomes hysterical at "
                 'the news of his sentence and tries to kill himself, but the '
                 "Friar promises to make Romeo's marriage to Juliet public and "
                 "gain the Prince's pardon. Romeo and Juliet celebrate their "
                 'wedding night before he leaves at dawn for Mantua. That '
                 'morning, Juliet discovers that her father has arranged for '
                 'her to marry Paris on Thursday. The Capulets, unaware that '
                 "Juliet is grieving for Romeo's exile rather than Tybalt's "
                 'death, believe the wedding will distract her from mourning. '
                 'Distressed at the prospect of a false marriage and isolated '
                 'from her family, Juliet seeks advice from Friar Laurence, '
                 'who offers her a sleeping potion to make her appear dead for '
                 '42 hours. During this time, the Friar will send a message to '
                 'Romeo in Mantua so that Romeo can return to Verona in time '
                 'for Juliet to awake. Juliet returns home and agrees to marry '
                 'Paris. In a moment of euphoria, Capulet brings the wedding '
                 'forward from Thursday to Wednesday, thereby forcing Juliet '
                 'to take the potion that night and reducing the time for the '
                 "message to reach Romeo. Early on Wednesday morning, Juliet's "
                 'seemingly lifeless body is discovered and she is placed in '
                 'the family tomb. Because an outbreak of the plague prevents '
                 "the Friar's messenger from leaving Verona, Romeo now "
                 "receives news of Juliet's death instead. Desperate, Romeo "
                 'buys poison from an apothecary and returns to Verona. Late '
                 'that night, Romeo enters the Capulet tomb, but is confronted '
                 'by Paris, whom he fights and kills. Still unaware that '
                 'Juliet is in fact alive, Romeo takes the poison and dies. '
                 'The Friar, arriving too late, discovers the bodies as Juliet '
                 'begins to stir. He begs her to leave with him, but Juliet '
                 "refuses, and then stabs herself with Romeo's dagger. As dawn "
                 'breaks, the Watch arrives, closely followed by the Prince, '
                 'who demands a full inquiry into what has happened. The two '
                 'families then arrive, and the Friar comes forward to explain '
                 'the tragic sequence of events. The deaths of Romeo and '
                 'Juliet finally bring the feud to an end as Montague and '
                 'Capulet join hands in peace.',

                 'Verrières, hires Julien Sorel, a young peasant who aspires '
                 'to the priesthood, as tutor for his children. The hiring of '
                 "Julien is calculated to enhance Rênal's prestige among the "
                 'wealthy liberals. Julien, ambitious and amoral, had hoped to '
                 'pursue a military career but has decided to enter the '
                 'priesthood as the most likely means to success. He chooses '
                 'hypocrisy as his weapon in his encounter with society. He '
                 'sees his position as tutor as the first step in his '
                 'ascension, which will culminate, he hopes, in Parisian '
                 'aristocracy. Mme. de Rênal innocently falls in love with '
                 'Julien after he has lived in the Rênal country home for some '
                 'time. When Julien discovers that he is loved, he decides '
                 'that he will seduce Mme. de Rênal as an expression of the '
                 'scorn he feels for her husband. His plan of seduction would '
                 'have failed miserably, so awkwardly does he execute it, were '
                 'Mme. de Rênal not hopelessly in love with him. Succumbing to '
                 "Julien's natural charm, which he displays in unguarded "
                 "moments, Mme. de Rênal becomes, in fact, Julien's mistress. "
                 'She educates him socially and in the local political '
                 'intrigues. She succeeds in having Julien awarded a much '
                 'coveted place in the guard of honor on the occasion of a '
                 'visit by Charles X. Their love affair is idyllic until one '
                 "of the Rênals' sons falls gravely ill, which Mme. de Rênal "
                 'interprets as divine punishment for her adultery. Soon M. de '
                 'Rênal receives an anonymous letter accusing Julien of having '
                 'seduced his wife. Mme. de Rênal succeeds in duping her '
                 'husband into believing that the accusation is false. She '
                 "convinces him that the letter comes from Valenod, Rênal's "
                 'rival and assistant, who has attempted in the past to court '
                 'Mme. de Rênal. Her husband believes her because he is '
                 'comfortably established and is horrified at the thought of a '
                 'scandal. In order to quiet the rumors, Julien moves into the '
                 "Rênals' townhouse in Verrières. Because of his brilliant "
                 'reputation as a tutor, he is invited to dinner by Valenod, '
                 'who would hope to hire Julien as the tutor for his own '
                 'children. A servant girl from the Rênal household, also in '
                 'love with Julien but spurned by him, denounces the lovers to '
                 'the former village priest, Chélan, who insists that Julien '
                 'leave Verrières to enter the seminary in Besançon. Through '
                 "Chélan's influence with Pirard, rector of the seminary, "
                 "Julien is awarded a scholarship. Julien's affair with Mme. "
                 'de Rênal is temporarily ended, but he visits her room for a '
                 "final rendezvous. Julien's first attempts to succeed as a "
                 'student meet with failure because he excels as a scholar, '
                 "and the Church's reactionary influence that prevails in the "
                 'seminary requires of its future priests docility and '
                 "intellectual conformity in mediocrity. Julien's superiority, "
                 'however, is appreciated by Rector Pirard, who makes Julien '
                 'his protégé. One day as Julien is assisting in the '
                 'decoration of the Besançon cathedral, he encounters Mme. de '
                 'Rênal, who promptly faints at the sight of him. Pirard '
                 'obtains a position for Julien as secretary to a powerful '
                 'aristocrat in Paris, the Marquis de La Mole, to whom Pirard '
                 'has been of invaluable assistance in a lawsuit. Pirard also '
                 'leaves Besançon for a comfortable parish in Paris. Before '
                 'going to Paris, Julien pays a last visit to Mme. de Rênal, '
                 'presenting himself at her window late at night. At first '
                 "rebuffed by his mistress' virtue, Julien artfully destroys "
                 'her resistance by announcing that his departure for Paris is '
                 'imminent and that they will never see each other again. Mme. '
                 'de Rênal acquiesces and Julien remains hidden to spend the '
                 'following day with her. Book II finds Julien in Paris as '
                 'secretary to the Marquis de La Mole. Soon Julien makes his '
                 'services indispensable to his employer, although his '
                 'provincial manners and inexperience in high society cause '
                 "him constant embarrassment. The marquis' proud daughter, "
                 'Mathilde, takes an interest in Julien when she overhears the '
                 "latter denouncing the sterility of the Mole's salon. "
                 'Mathilde is bored with the convention and barrenness of the '
                 'aristocracy of which she is a part. She is in need of '
                 'diversion, and Julien will provide it for her. The marquis '
                 "finds Julien's intelligence and wit very refreshing, and "
                 'ultimately Julien becomes almost a son to the marquis. The '
                 'latter sends Julien to London on a diplomatic mission in '
                 'order that he may gain experience and as a pretext to have '
                 'Julien awarded a decoration. At the behest of Mathilde, '
                 'Julien attends a ball, where he makes the acquaintance of a '
                 'liberal aristocrat condemned to die. Mathilde is the most '
                 'sought-after beauty of the season, but Julien hardly notices '
                 'her, so inspired is he by the hero he has met. Mathilde, on '
                 'the other hand, sees in Julien a reincarnation of her '
                 "illustrious ancestor, Boniface de La Mole, a queen's lover "
                 'who was beheaded. Mathilde falls in love with Julien. Julien '
                 'is unable to decide if he is loved or if Mathilde and her '
                 'brother and their friends are trying to make of him a dupe. '
                 "Julien's attempt to leave Paris on a business trip for the "
                 'marquis moves Mathilde to a declaration of love. Julien, '
                 'still distrustful, takes precautions to safeguard his '
                 "reputation, sending Mathilde's avowal to his friend, Fouqué. "
                 'Alleging another business trip, Julien receives an '
                 'invitation from Mathilde to visit her in her room late at '
                 'night. Still convinced that he is being tricked, Julien '
                 'nonetheless appears at the appointed hour, and after much '
                 'mutual embarrassment, Mathilde becomes his mistress. '
                 'Mathilde now fears that she has given herself a master, and '
                 'she repents of having compromised herself. Julien discovers '
                 'that he is desperately in love with Mathilde, but her ardor '
                 'has cooled. Unfortunately for Julien, Mathilde is only '
                 'capable of loving him when she thinks that she is not loved '
                 'by him. When in a moment of anger Julien one day appears to '
                 'threaten her life, she is in love again. Their second '
                 'rendezvous occurs, but Mathilde again repents immediately '
                 'after. Julien, tormented by passion, is called upon by the '
                 'marquis to serve as secretary at a secret meeting of '
                 'reactionary aristocrats and to deliver a secret message to '
                 'London. Successfully fulfilling his mission, Julien then '
                 'goes to Strasbourg, where he meets a former acquaintance '
                 "from London, who advises him how to reawaken Mathilde's love "
                 'by jealousy. Julien returns to Paris to execute his plan, '
                 'choosing a prude to court by means of love letters furnished '
                 'to him by his friend. Mathilde responds to the stratagem, '
                 'but Julien realizes that to keep her love alive he must love '
                 'her at a distance. Mathilde is pregnant, and after the '
                 "marquis' rage has subsided at the announcement of this news, "
                 'the latter finally agrees to obtain an army commission for '
                 'Julien and to encourage his career. Julien occupies his new '
                 'post in Strasbourg but receives word from Mathilde to return '
                 "to Paris, that all is lost. In checking on Julien's past, "
                 'the marquis has learned from Mme. de Rênal, in a letter '
                 'dictated by her confessor, that Julien is an opportunist who '
                 'succeeds by seducing women. Learning this, Julien hurries to '
                 'Verrières, arms himself, and shoots Mme. de Rênal at church. '
                 'Imprisoned and awaiting trial for attempted murder, Julien '
                 'is visited by Mathilde, who attempts to negotiate his '
                 'acquittal with the Jesuits. Julien is resigned to die and in '
                 'the solitude of his prison cell discovers that he is still '
                 'in love with Mme. de Rênal, whom he had only wounded, and '
                 'that his love for Mathilde has disappeared. During the '
                 'trial, in spite of his resolution not to speak in his own '
                 'defense, Julien informs the court that he is not being tried '
                 'for attempted murder but for having attempted to rise above '
                 'his social class. The jury finds Julien guilty and he is '
                 'sentenced to be guillotined. During his last days in prison, '
                 'Julien finds peace and happiness in his reflections and '

                 'execution, Mathilde, in a re-enactment of a scene from the '
                 "Mole family history, furtively steals Julien's severed head "

 'summary_text': 'The Red Badge of Courage is the story of Henry Fleming, a '
                 'teenager who enlists with the Union Army in the hopes of '
                 'fulfilling his dreams of glory. Shortly after enlisting, the '
                 'reality of his decision sets in. He experiences tedious '
                 'waiting, not immediate glory. The more he waits for battle, '
                 'the more doubt and fear creep into his mind. When he finally '
                 'engages in his first battle, he blindly fires into the '
                 'battle haze, never seeing his enemy. As the next enemy '
                 "assault approaches, Henry's fears of death overwhelm him, "
                 'and he runs from the field. Henry continues his retreat for '
                 'some time, even after he overhears that his regiment '
                 'repelled the enemy. When he finally slows and rests, he '
                 'hears the sound of a renewed battle and, ironically, he '
                 'returns to the battle from which he has fled. He comes upon '
                 'many wounded men returning from the front to get medical '
                 'assistance. One of these wounded soldiers, identified as "a '
                 'tattered soldier," befriends Henry and begins a conversation '
                 'with him; however, when the tattered soldier asks Henry '
                 'where he is wounded, Henry evades the question by leaving '
                 'him and drifting into the crowd of soldiers. As Henry '
                 'continues walking with the wounded, he sees a veteran '
                 'soldier of his company, Jim Conklin, who is mortally '
                 'wounded. Henry follows Jim, and, eventually, the tattered '
                 'soldier joins them. When Jim suddenly collapses and dies, '
                 'Henry is devastated. The tattered soldier again asks Henry '
                 "about his wound. Again, Henry can't explain that he has no "
                 'wound, so he leaves the disoriented, wounded, tattered '
                 'soldier stumbling in the field. Henry anguishes over his '
                 "lack of courage, but he can't overcome the guilt and "
                 'self-hatred that stop him from returning to his regiment. He '
                 'hears the noise of a battle and sees reinforcement troops '
                 'heading toward the front. As he watches, the battle turns '
                 'against the Union forces, and many of the men begin to '
                 'retreat. Henry gets caught up in their retreat. He tries to '
                 'stop a retreating soldier to find out what is happening; '
                 'however, the soldier only wants to get away, so he hits '
                 'Henry over the head with his rifle, leaving Henry with a '
                 'serious head wound. He is dazed by the blow and wanders back '
                 'through the woods. Henry is then befriended by a cheery '
                 'soldier who returns him to his regiment. Henry fears being '
                 'ridiculed by his comrades on his return, but when he enters '
                 'his camp, two soldiers, Wilson and Simpson, see his injury '
                 'and immediately begin ministering to him. They assume that '
                 'Henry was hurt in battle; however, Simpson asks Henry about '
                 "his whereabouts, and Henry can't answer. As the regiment "
                 'prepares to move out, Wilson asks Henry to return a packet '
                 'of letters that he gave Henry before the first battle. '
                 '(Wilson feared that he was going to die in battle, and he '
                 'wanted Henry to give the letters to his family.) Henry '
                 'realizes that Wilson was also afraid of battle, and Henry is '
                 'overjoyed to think that he now has power, and a weapon, to '
                 "use to hold over somebody else's head. This knowledge gives "
                 'Henry courage and restores his confidence. Henry converts '
                 'his fear of the enemy into anger and becomes a leader, '
                 'fighting boldly at the side of his lieutenant. Henry becomes '
                 'such a confident, assertive, aggressive soldier that, '
                 'ironically, he becomes a fighting machine himself. Henry '
                 'resolves his guilt over abandoning the tattered soldier by '
                 'deciding to use the memory of this selfish, uncaring act to '
                 'keep himself humble — to control any egotism he feels '
                 "because of his now strong fighting ability. When Henry's "
                 'regiment is chosen to charge the enemy, Henry leads the '
                 'charge with the lieutenant, and, eventually, he even assumes '
                 'the role of color bearer for the regiment after the color '
                 "sergeant is killed. Henry's transformation from a fearful, "
                 'lost, doubting youth, to a courageous, confident, duty-bound '
                 'soldier is the essence of the novel. It is the story of the '
                 'growth of a young man from innocence to maturity.',

                 'Thomasin Yeobright, who was to have married Damon Wildeve '
                 'that day. Mrs. Yeobright takes Thomasin with her to see '
                 'Wildeve at the inn he operates in order to demand an '
                 'explanation of his failure to marry her. When their bonfire '
                 'has burned out, the locals come to serenade Thomasin and '
                 'Wildeve, thinking them to be newly married and wanting to '
                 'celebrate. When Wildeve is able to get rid of them he starts '
                 'off to see Eustacia Vye, the mysterious figure Venn saw '
                 'earlier, standing on Rainbarrow. Eustacia watches for '
                 'Wildeve on Rainbarrow, returning now and then to check on '
                 "the signal fire she has had built before her grandfather's "
                 "house. (Captain Vye is the chance acquaintance of Venn's). "
                 "Wildeve was once Eustacia's lover, but she has not seen him "
                 'since his interest in Thomasin. Eventually, Wildeve does '
                 'finally arrive. Venn accidentally learns of the meeting '
                 'between Eustacia and Wildeve. A longtime admirer and once '
                 'rejected suitor of Thomasin, Venn thinks he can score points '
                 'with her. He now resolves to help her and purposely '
                 'overhears the conversation between Eustacia and Wildeve the '
                 'next time they meet on Rainbarrow. Venn then calls on '
                 'Eustacia to get her to help Thomasin, finally telling her he '
                 'knows about her meetings with Wildeve. Venn also informs '
                 'Mrs. Yeobright he would like to marry her niece. Though he '
                 'is rejected, the aunt uses him as a means to put pressure on '
                 'Wildeve. Wildeve goes immediately to Eustacia to convince '
                 'her to leave with him, but she will not answer right away. '
                 'The news of the arrival for the Christmas holidays of Mrs. '
                 "Yeobright's son, Clym, is widely talked about on the heath, "
                 "including Captain Vye's house, where Eustacia also hears "
                 'about his impending visit. Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin make '
                 "preparations for Clym's arrival. After getting a glimpse of "
                 'him, Eustacia is fascinated by him. She arranges to '
                 'substitute for one of the boys in the traditional Christmas '
                 'mumming (a play or pageant in which the actors use gestures, '
                 'masks, props, and elaborate makeup, but do not have spoken '
                 'lines), the first performance of which is at a party Mrs. '
                 'Yeobright is giving. During the performance at the party, '
                 'Eustacia succeeds in meeting Clym while she is in costume. '
                 'Now that her interest in Wildeve has paled, Eustacia makes '
                 'clear to Venn that she would like to see Wildeve married to '
                 'Thomasin. They do marry, with Eustacia serving as witness. '
                 'Mrs. Yeobright, who has once opposed the marriage, does not '
                 'attend; and Clym, who has been away from home, finds out '
                 'about the marriage after it has taken place. Giving up his '
                 'business career in Paris, Clym has returned to Egdon Heath '
                 "to set up as a schoolteacher to those who can't afford "
                 'existing schools. Mrs. Yeobright disapproves, thinking '
                 "Clym's career goals do not show enough ambition. Clym meets "
                 'Eustacia, in her own person this time, and is strongly '
                 'attracted to her, an attraction that Mrs. Yeobright argues '
                 'against. Clym sees Eustacia regularly, usually on the heath, '
                 'for several months and then asks her to marry him. She says '
                 'yes, though she hopes he will finally give up his plans and '
                 'take her to Paris. When Mrs. Yeobright and Clym quarrel over '
                 'his love of Eustacia and he feels forced to leave his '
                 "mother's house, he decides he and Eustacia should marry "
                 'right away and live for a time on the heath. Clym finds a '
                 'cottage and moves from home, leaving his mother disconsolate '
                 "and bitter. Wildeve's interest in Eustacia revives when he "
                 'hears of her approaching marriage. On the occasion of their '
                 'marriage, Mrs. Yeobright decides to send a gift of money. '
                 'Her son, Clym, is marrying Eustacia against her wishes, and '
                 'she hopes that, by offering this gift, she and her son can '
                 'repair their relationship. The other half of the money is to '
                 'go to her niece, Thomasin, who has recently married Damon '
                 "Wildeve, Eustacia's former lover. Unfortunately, Mrs. "
                 'Yeobright selects as her messenger the inept Christian '
                 'Cantle, the village simpleton. Cantle loses the money '
                 "gambling with Wildeve, who wants revenge on his wife's aunt "
                 'for not trusting him with the money. Venn, protecting '
                 'Thomasin, wins it back from Wildeve, but not understanding '
                 'that part of it should go to Clym, Venn he delivers it all '
                 'to Thomasin. Eustacia and Clym for a time live a secluded '
                 'life. When Mrs. Yeobright receives no response from Clym '
                 'about the money, she calls on Eustacia, and they quarrel '
                 'bitterly. Clym, hurrying his study to be a teacher so as to '
                 'pacify the impatient Eustacia, develops severe eye trouble '
                 "and is forced to suspend his work. To his wife's dismay, he "
                 'takes up furze cutting ( furze is a low, prickly shrub) as a '
                 'way of making a little money and getting exercise. To '
                 'Eustacia, this is a far cry from what she yearns for — the '
                 'gay life of the great world, especially as represented by '
                 'Paris — and since Clym had business and connections in '
                 'Paris, Eustacia saw him as a way out of her constrained life '
                 'on the heath. To compensate, she goes to a gipsying (a '
                 'dance) and unexpectedly encounters Wildeve and dances with '
                 'him. Venn sees them together and attempts to discourage '
                 "Wildeve's loitering around Clym's house at night. Persuaded "
                 'by Venn to forget her pride and call on her son, Mrs. '
                 'Yeobright starts the long walk to his house on a hot August '
                 'day. She sees Wildeve admitted by Eustacia before she can '
                 "get there; when she knocks on the door, Clym's wife looks "
                 "out the window but doesn't answer. The older woman tries to "
                 'walk back home, stops in exhaustion, and is bitten by an '
                 'adder. She is later discovered by Clym, who has set off for '
                 'her house to attempt a reconciliation, but even medical '
                 'attention cannot save her and she dies. Clym blames himself '
                 'for her death. Eustacia is nearby when Mrs. Yeobright dies '
                 "but doesn't make an appearance; she has accidentally "
                 'encountered Wildeve, who has lately come into an '
                 'inheritance. Clym for some time is ill and irrational '
                 "because of his mother's death. His constant blaming of "
                 'himself exhausts Eustacia, and she tries to find consolation '
                 'in Wildeve. Once back to normal again, Clym sets out to '
                 'discover what his mother was doing on the heath. From Mrs. '
                 "Yeobright's handyman, Cantle, from Venn, and a young boy who "
                 'came across his mother as she tried to get home that day, '
                 'Clym learns what happened. He accuses Eustacia of cruelty to '
                 'his mother. When Clym adds the charge of deception of '
                 'himself as a husband, the relationship between him and '
                 'Eustacia is effectively over. She leaves his house to return '
                 "to Captain Vye's. At her grandfather's, Eustacia doesn't "
                 'know how to occupy herself and once even thinks of suicide. '
                 'A bonfire is lit for her when the Fifth of November comes, '
                 'an inadvertent signal to Wildeve, who offers to help '
                 "Eustacia get away from the heath to Paris. On Thomasin's "
                 "advice, Clym, now moved back to his mother's house, writes "
                 'to ask his wife to return to him. On the evening of the '
                 'sixth of November, Eustacia signals to Wildeve that she '
                 "wants to go, by chance not getting Clym's letter before she "
                 'leaves the house. Thomasin, has suspicions about Wildeve. '
                 'She and Captain Vye, who finds out Eustacia has left the '
                 "house very late at night, come to ask Clym's help. Thomasin "
                 "tries to get back home, finally with Venn's assistance. "
                 'While Wildeve waits with a horse cart for Eustacia, and Clym '
                 'searches for his wife, Eustacia on this dark, stormy night '
                 'throws herself in a stream near a weir. Both Wildeve and '
                 'Clym try to rescue her, but it is Venn who pulls out both '
                 'men as well as Eustacia. Of the three, only Clym survives. '
                 "After her husband's death, Thomasin moves into the family "
                 'home with Clym. Venn, having given up the reddle trade, '
                 'calls on her, and they become interested in each other. '
                 'However, Clym thinks he ought to ask his cousin to marry him '
                 'since his mother wished it. But Thomasin and Venn decide to '
                 'marry and do. Clym is last seen on top of Rainbarrow, '
                 'performing as an itinerant preacher of moral lectures.',

 'summary_text': 'In the late 1950s, 15 years after graduation, Gene Forrester '
                 'returns to Devon, an elite prep school in New Hampshire. '
                 'Walking through the campus in the cold November mist, Gene '
                 'remembers his experiences at Devon during World War II, '
                 'especially the Summer Session of 1942, when he was 16 years '
                 'old. At a tree by the river, Gene thinks of his friend and '
                 'roommate, Phineas (nicknamed Finny), the best athlete in the '
                 'school. As the story moves into the past, Finny jumps from a '
                 'high limb of the tree into the river — an activity forbidden '
                 'to all but the oldest Devon boys — and dares Gene to jump as '
                 'well. Gene jumps, but is frightened. Finny, however, takes '
                 'such delight in the dangerous, forbidden jump that he forms '
                 'the Suicide Society and invites all the Devon boys to test '
                 'their courage by jumping from the tree into the river. At '
                 'each initiation, Gene and Finny make the first jump, but '
                 "Gene never gets over his fear. Finny's status as the best "
                 'athlete inspires Gene to strive to become the best student '
                 'in the school. Gene applies himself to his studies '
                 'seriously, but feels pressure from Finny to join in his '
                 'activities, especially the Suicide Society. After failing a '
                 'math test because of a forbidden trip to the beach, Gene '
                 'suspects that Finny is deliberately trying to sabotage his '
                 'studying. This silent resentment builds until the end of the '
                 'summer, when Finny insists that Gene leave his books to jump '
                 'from the tree again. High in the tree with his friend, Gene '
                 'impulsively jounces the limb and causes Finny to fall. '
                 "Finny's shattered leg ends his involvement in sports, a "
                 'consequence that brings the guilty and fearful Gene to '
                 "tears. Once in the infirmary and again at Finny's home, "
                 'where he is recovering, Gene tries to confess that he caused '
                 "the fall. But Finny's trust in Gene is absolute, and he "
                 'refuses to believe the confession. Without Finny around, '
                 'Gene grows closer to Brinker Hadley, a student leader who '
                 'teases him with the accusation that he got rid of Finny to '
                 "have their room to himself. Brinker's joking frightens and "
                 "angers Gene, but his new friend's energy also inspires him. "
                 'One night, after Brinker announces his intention to enlist '
                 'immediately, Gene decides to enter military service as well, '
                 "a resolution that disappears suddenly upon Finny's return. "
                 'Finny tells Gene that he must become an athlete for both of '
                 'them and proposes to train him for the 1944 Olympics. When '
                 'Gene tries to explain that the war will most certainly make '
                 'the Olympics impossible, Finny announces that the war is a '
                 "fake. Finny's dream of the 1944 Olympics becomes a shared "
                 'reality between the friends as the former athlete trains his '
                 'replacement. Gene joins his friend in a peaceful retreat '
                 "from the world, celebrated in the school's (unofficial) "
                 "Winter Carnival. Even a friend's enlistment and emotional "
                 'breakdown does not intrude upon the peace Gene finds with '
                 'Finny, until one evening when Brinker and some of the other '
                 'boys drag Gene and Finny to the Assembly Room, where they '
                 "propose to get to the truth about Finny's injury. In a mock "
                 'trial, Brinker questions Finny, searching for proof of '
                 "Gene's responsibility in his fall. When another boy's memory "
                 "of the fall opens Finny's eyes to his friend's guilt, he "
                 'lurches angrily from the room, falling on the stairs and '
                 'breaking his leg again. At a distance, Gene follows Finny to '
                 'the infirmary, hoping to talk with him alone. Finny, '
                 'however, will not talk with Gene until the next day, when he '
                 'asks sadly if his friend really meant to hurt him or if it '
                 'were simply an unconscious impulse. Gene insists that he '
                 'acted without hatred — blindly — and Finny accepts the '
                 'explanation with relief. Later that day, in an operation to '
                 'set the leg again, Finny dies when some marrow from the '
                 'broken bone enters the bloodstream and stops his heart. Gene '
                 'accepts the news without crying, because he feels as if he '
                 'has died, too. Later, after the war, Gene looks back and '
                 "understands that he fought his real war at Devon. Gene's "
                 'true enemy was the narrow, spiteful self that harbored '
                 'jealousy, and that self died with Finny.',

 'summary_text': 'Blanche DuBois arrives to visit her sister, Mrs. Stella '
                 'Kowalski, who lives in the French Quarter of New Orleans. '
                 'She is shocked by the disreputable looks of the place. While '
                 'a neighbor goes to find Stella, Blanche looks around the '
                 'apartment for a drink. When her sister comes, Blanche quite '
                 'frankly criticizes the place. She explains that she has come '
                 'for a visit because her nerves are shattered from teaching. '
                 'Noticing that the apartment has only two rooms, she has '
                 "qualms about staying but she tells Stella that she can't "
                 'stand being alone. She explains to Stella that their old '
                 'ancestral home, Belle Reve, has been lost. While Stella goes '
                 'to the bathroom, Stanley, her husband, enters and meets '
                 'Blanche. He questions her about her past and especially '
                 'about her earlier marriage, which upsets Blanche to the '
                 'point that she feels sick. The following night Stella and '
                 'Blanche plan to have dinner out and go to a movie while '
                 'Stanley plays poker with his friends. But before they leave, '
                 'Stanley wants to know how Belle Reve was lost. Blanche tries '
                 'to explain and gives him all the papers and documents '
                 'pertaining to the place. Later that night when Blanche and '
                 'Stella return from their movie, the men are still playing '
                 "poker. Blanche meets Mitch, one of Stanley's friends, who "
                 'seems to be more sensitive than the others. While Mitch is '
                 'in the second room talking to Blanche, Stanley becomes angry '
                 'over a series of incidents, especially when Blanche turns on '
                 'the radio. He throws the radio out the window, hits Stella '
                 'when she tries to stop him, and has to be held by the other '
                 'men to be kept from doing more damage. Blanche takes Stella '
                 'and runs upstairs. When Stanley recovers, he calls for '
                 'Stella to come down and she does. The next morning, Blanche '
                 'goes to Stella and tries to make her see that Stanley is an '
                 'animal. She is shocked that Stella could have returned to '
                 'him. But Stella assures her that Stanley was gentle when she '
                 'returned and that she loves him. As Blanche begins '
                 'describing Stanley, he comes in and overhears the '
                 "conversation but doesn't say a thing. Some time later, "
                 'Blanche is dressing for a date with Mitch. She tells Stella '
                 'that she wants Mitch because she is so tired of struggling '
                 'against the world. Stella assures her it will happen. She '
                 'leaves with Stanley to go bowling; just before Mitch '
                 'arrives, a paper boy comes by and Blanche detains him long '
                 'enough to kiss him because he reminds her of her young '
                 'husband. When Blanche and Mitch return from their date, '
                 'Blanche explains to Mitch how much Stanley apparently hates '
                 'her. She thinks that Stanley will be her destroyer. She '
                 'tells Mitch about her past life, how once she was married to '
                 'a young boy whom she later discovered with an older man. '
                 'Later that night, her young husband killed himself as a '
                 'result of a harsh remark that Blanche made to him. Mitch '
                 'tells Blanche that they both need each other. It is later in '
                 'mid-September. Stella is preparing a birthday cake for '
                 'Blanche. Stanley comes home and tells Stella that he now has '
                 'the lowdown on Blanche. It seems that she lived such a wild '
                 'life in Laurel that she was asked to leave the town. Even '
                 'the army had referred to Blanche as being out-of-bounds. '
                 "Stanley then tells her that Mitch won't be coming over and "
                 'that Blanche will leave Tuesday on a Greyhound bus. Later '
                 'that evening Blanche cannot understand why Mitch does not '
                 'come. After a scene between Stanley and Stella, Stanley '
                 'gives Blanche her birthday present — a ticket back to '
                 'Laurel, Mississippi. As Stanley is about to leave, Stella '
                 'has her first labor pains and has to be taken to the '
                 'hospital. Mitch arrives later that evening. Blanche has been '
                 'drinking rather heavily. He confronts her with her past '
                 'life. At first she tries to deny it, but then she confesses '
                 'that after the death of her young husband, nothing but '
                 'intimacies with strangers seemed to have any meaning for '
                 'her. Mitch then tries to get her to sleep with him, and '
                 'Blanche demands marriage. Mitch tells her she is not good '
                 'enough, and Blanche screams fire so as to make Mitch leave. '
                 'Later that night, Stanley returns from the hospital to find '
                 'Blanche dressed in an old faded evening dress. He tells her '
                 "that the baby won't come before morning. She is frightened "
                 'to stay with him, especially when he begins confronting her '
                 'with all the lies she has told. As she tries to move around '
                 "him, he decides that she wouldn't be too bad to interfere "
                 'with. After a scuffle, he rapes her. Three weeks later, '
                 "Stella is packing Blanche's clothes and waiting for a doctor "
                 'and an attendant to come and take her to the state mental '
                 "institution. Stella refuses to believe Blanche's story that "
                 'Stanley raped her. Blanche thinks that an old boy friend is '
                 'coming to take her on a cruise. When the attendant arrives, '
                 "she doesn't recognize him and tries to run away. Stanley and "
                 'an assistant trap Blanche. The doctor approaches and Blanche '
                 'is quite willing to go with him, having always depended on '
                 'the kindness of strangers.',

                 'and from his travels to the planet Tralfamadore '
                 '(Trawl-fahm-uh-door). Billy is able to move both forwards '
                 'and backwards through his lifetime in an arbitrary cycle of '
                 'events. Enduring the tedious life of a 1950s optometrist in '
                 'Ilium, New York, he is the lover of a former pornographic '
                 'movie star on the planet Tralfamadore and simultaneously an '
                 'American prisoner of war (POW) in Nazi Germany. Vonnegut '
                 "uses Billy's ability to travel in time as a device to evoke "
                 "a wide range of scenes from Billy's life. The "
                 'multidimensional panorama points out the importance of '
                 'cyclical time and psychological experience during events '
                 'that receive equal emphasis in linear time. While some '
                 'scenes become so jumbled that they seem to have no cause or '
                 "effect, we must remember Vonnegut's comments on the title "

                 'and he invites us to become psychologists helping Billy make '
                 "sense of his life. Slaughterhouse-Five 's central topic is "
                 'the horror of the Dresden bombing. As a witness to the '
                 'destruction, Billy confronts fundamental questions about the '
                 'meanings of life and death. Traumatized by the events in '
                 'Dresden, Billy can provide no answers. As a soldier, he is '
                 'dislocated in a system where there is no reward, no '
                 'punishment, and no justice. Although his life as an '
                 'optometrist, a husband, and a father is materially '
                 'fulfilling, he is unable to find peace of mind because of '
                 'the trauma he suffered in Dresden. Ultimately, Billy '

                 'will: Billy cannot change the past, the present, or the '
                 'future. In the final analysis, Vonnegut suggests that life '
                 'is like a simple, meaningless limerick, a nonsensical verse '
                 'that never ends because it continuously repeats itself. At '

                 '"Poo-tee-weet?" at the end of the novel, Billy hears the '

                 'to many Japanese-Americans. Snow Falling on Cedars opens in '
                 "Judge Lew Fielding's courtroom as the trial of one of these "
                 'Japanese-Americans, Kabuo Miyamoto, who is on trial for '
                 'killing fellow fisherman Carl Heine, Jr., commences. The '
                 "story line of Kabuo's trial is the only one in Snow Falling "
                 'on Cedars that is told in chronological order. Early '
                 'testimony by the sheriff and his deputy provides the facts '
                 'in the case: They were called to investigate the drifting of '
                 "the Susan Marie, Carl's boat, and they found his body in his "
                 "own fishing nets. Although the sheriff announced that Carl's "
                 "death was an accident, everything didn't quite add up, so he "
                 "got a warrant to search Kabuo's boat, the Islander, for the "
                 "murder weapon. Finding blood on the butt end of Kabuo's "
                 'fishing gaff, the sheriff arrested him. As the trial '
                 "progresses, the facts of Kabuo's case are revealed, as is "
                 'the truth about what happened that night. Throughout the '
                 'three-day trial, stories and history are told and retold '
                 'from shifting perspectives and points of view; information '
                 'is leaked slowly and deliberately, and two separate story '
                 'lines develop in the form of memory and testimony. The first '
                 "major story line is the interracial love story. Kabuo's "
                 "wife, Hatsue, shares a past with the island's only reporter, "
                 'Ishmael Chambers. Their connection is established in the '
                 'first chapter, but the extent of their involvement is '
                 'revealed gradually. They grew up together, playing on the '
                 'beach, looking for crabs, and shared a first kiss. Years '
                 'later they kissed again, and a secret, teenage love affair '
                 "blossomed. They didn't tell their families or their friends. "
                 'At school they acted like strangers. Because of their '
                 'cultural differences, they kept their interracial '
                 'relationship hidden. During their senior year, Ishmael was '
                 'certain he was falling more and more in love with Hatsue, '
                 'while she was becoming more and more confused about her '
                 'sense of responsibility to herself and her family. Before '
                 'they could work through their feelings for one another, they '
                 'were separated. Hatsue and her family were sent to Manzanar, '
                 'a World War II Japanese internment camp. There her mother '
                 "found out about Hatsue's affair and pressured her into "
                 'writing a "Dear John" letter. At Manzanar, Hatsue, '
                 'determined to get on with her life, marries Kabuo. After '
                 'receiving the letter from Hatsue, Ishmael hates her, and he '
                 'harbors this hate for years. During the war, he loses his '
                 'arm, and his hate grows. After the war, he sees her around '
                 'the island, with her children, and he is still bitter. He '
                 'views the trial as his chance to get back in her life, no '
                 'matter what the cost. Besides providing the background to '
                 'the interracial love story, memories and testimony also '
                 'provide the story of an illegal land deal that was never '
                 'completed. Carl Heine, Sr., agreed to sell seven acres of '
                 "land to Zenhichi Miyamoto, Kabuo's father, in an agreement "
                 'that sidestepped existing laws. This lease-to-own agreement '
                 'lasted eight years. During the war, Carl Sr. died, and '
                 'because of his internment, Zenhichi Miyamoto missed the last '
                 "two payments. Carl's wife, Etta, who never approved of her "
                 "husband's deal anyway, sold the land to Ole Jurgensen. Kabuo "
                 'visited both Ole Jurgensen and Etta Heine after the war, '
                 'staking claim to the seven acres he refers to as his '
                 "family's land. He even offered to buy it back, but Jurgensen "
                 "isn't interested. Ten years later, after a stroke rendered "
                 'him unable to work all of his land, Jurgensen put his farm '
                 'up for sale. Carl junior stopped by right after the sign '
                 'went up and made a deal to buy the land; earnest money '
                 'changed hands. Later that same day, Kabuo stopped by and was '
                 'devastated to learn that he arrived too late. Kabuo then '
                 'approached Carl junior, asking him to sell the seven acres '
                 'of land to him. Carl agreed to think about it. At this '
                 "point, toward the end of Kabuo's trial, the two separate "
                 'story lines merge. For the most part, the interracial love '
                 'story was private, whereas the quarrel over the land was '
                 'more public. Clearly, Kabuo had both a motive and a method '
                 'to kill Carl. Evidence places him at the scene of the crime, '
                 'and he is also shown to be a liar. The night before the end '
                 'of the trial, Ishmael makes a discovery. While visiting the '
                 'lighthouse for a story on the weather, he finds the notes '
                 'from the night watchman that can clear Kabuo. Ishmael has to '
                 'decide what to do: Does he keep the information to himself, '
                 "use his newspaper to support Kabuo's case, and then work "
                 "himself back into Hatsue's life while her husband is in "
                 'jail, or does he reveal what he knows? The end of the novel '
                 "focuses on Ishmael's decision-making process and reveals "
                 'exactly what happened on the night in question. The search '
                 'for truth and justice comes to an end as Ishmael makes the '
                 'morally and ethically correct decision to share his '
                 'discovery. He also decides to make peace with Hatsue and get '
                 'on with his life.',

                 'on his quest. At Christmas, a knight who is completely green '
                 "rides into King Arthur's hall. The Green Knight proposes a "
                 'game: Any knight brave enough to strike off the Green '
                 "Knight's head may keep the Green Knight's ax, but that man "
                 'must accept a return stroke in one year. Gawain accepts the '

                 'Gawain sets out in search of the Green Chapel. He finds a '
                 'castle in the wilderness. The lord of the castle asks Gawain '
                 "to stay until New Year's Day, because the Green Chapel is "
                 'nearby. The lord proposes an agreement: He will go out '

                 'will exchange whatever they have gained at the end of the '

 'book_title': 'Silas Marner',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'In the village of Raveloe lives a weaver named Silas Marner. '
                 'He is viewed with distrust by the local people because he '
                 'comes from a distant part of the country. In addition, he '
                 'lives completely alone, and he has been known to have '
                 'strange fits. For fifteen years he has lived like this. '
                 'Fifteen years earlier, Silas was a respected member of a '
                 'church at Lantern Yard in a city to the north. His fits were '
                 'regarded there as a mark of special closeness to the Holy '
                 'Spirit. He had a close friend named William Dane, and he was '
                 'engaged to marry a serving girl named Sarah. But one day the '
                 'elder deacon fell ill and had to be tended day and night by '
                 'members of the congregation, as he was a childless widower. '
                 "During Silas' watch, a bag of money disappears from a drawer "
                 "by the deacon's bed. Silas' knife is found in the drawer, "
                 'but Silas swears he is innocent and asks that his room be '
                 'searched. The empty bag is found there by William Dane. Then '
                 'Silas remembers that he last used the knife to cut a strap '
                 'for William, but he says nothing to the others. In order to '
                 'find out the truth, the church members resort to prayer and '
                 'drawing of lots, and the lots declare Silas guilty. Silas, '
                 'betrayed by his friend and now by his God, declares that '
                 'there is no just God. He is sure that Sarah will desert him '
                 'too, and he takes refuge in his work. He soon receives word '
                 'from Sarah that their engagement is ended, and a month later '
                 'she marries William Dane. Soon afterward Silas leaves '
                 'Lantern Yard. He settles in Raveloe, where he feels hidden '
                 'even from God. His work is at first his only solace, but '
                 'soon he begins to receive gold for his cloth; the gold gives '
                 'him a kind of companionship. He works harder and harder to '
                 'earn more of it and stores it in a bag beneath his floor. '
                 'His contacts with humanity wither. Once he gives help to a '
                 'woman who is ill by treating her with herbs as his mother '
                 'taught him, but this action gives him a reputation as a '
                 'maker of charms. People come for miles to ask his help, and '
                 'he cannot give any. As a result, he is believed to cause '
                 'other misfortunes and be in league with the devil. After '
                 'that, Silas is more alone than ever. The greatest man of '
                 'Raveloe is Squire Cass. His wife is dead, and his sons are '
                 'left to their own devices. Some trouble results from this: '
                 'the eldest son, Godfrey, has made a hasty marriage with a '
                 'woman of poor reputation, and the second son, Dunstan, is '
                 'blackmailing Godfrey to keep their father from knowing. '
                 'Godfrey has given Dunstan some rent money from one of his '
                 "father's tenants; now the Squire wants the money, so Godfrey "
                 'gives Dunstan his horse to sell to raise the cash. On the '
                 'way to the hunt where he hopes to sell the horse, Dunstan '
                 "passes the weaver's cottage. This sight gives him the idea "
                 'of borrowing the money from Marner, but he rather likes the '
                 'idea of vexing his brother, so he continues to the hunt and '
                 'makes the sale. However, instead of turning over the horse '
                 'at once, he rides in the chase and kills the animal on a '
                 'stake. Dunstan begins to walk home. It becomes dark and '
                 'foggy before he can reach there, and in the darkness he '
                 "comes to Marner's cottage. Dunstan goes there to borrow a "
                 'lantern and to try to get some money out of the weaver. He '
                 'finds no one there. Searching around the floor, he soon '
                 'finds where the money is hidden. He replaces the bricks that '
                 'had covered it and carries the money away. Silas has poor '
                 'eyesight, and on his return he finds nothing wrong until he '
                 'goes to take out his money to count it. When he cannot find '
                 'it, he feels that once again he has been robbed by an unseen '
                 'power. However, he clings to the hope that there was a human '
                 'thief, and he goes off to the village inn to find the '
                 'constable. At the inn, the conversation has been of ghosts, '
                 'and when Silas bursts in he himself is momentarily taken for '
                 'a ghost. But Silas is so worked up that it is apparent he is '
                 'no ghost, and when he tells of the robbery, there is '
                 'immediately sympathy for him. His helplessness removes any '
                 'feeling that he is connected with the devil. Some of the men '
                 'set out after the constable. The news of the robbery spreads '
                 'quickly, and there is soon general agreement that the thief '
                 'must have been an itinerant peddler who had been in the '
                 'neighborhood: no other stranger has been noticed, and no '
                 "local person could be suspected. Dunstan's disappearance is "
                 'not thought strange because that has happened before. '
                 'Godfrey is not surprised either, for he soon learns that '
                 'Dunstan has killed his horse. Now he decides to tell his '
                 'father of his marriage. He leads up to this by telling of '
                 'his horse and of the rent money that he had given Dunstan; '
                 'but he gets no farther, for his father explodes with anger, '
                 'which leaves Godfrey in a worse position than ever. Silas is '
                 'now treated with some consideration by his neighbors. Dolly '
                 'Winthrop, especially, visits Silas and tries to coax him '
                 'into attending church, at least on Christmas. However, Silas '
                 'finds no connection between local religious customs and '
                 'those he knows of, and Christmas finds him at home as usual. '
                 "Christmas and New Year's are the time of special festivals "
                 "in Raveloe. The most important celebration is the New Year's "
                 "dance at Squire Cass' home. There, Godfrey is unable to keep "
                 'himself away from Nancy Lammeter, the girl he has always '
                 'intended to marry. Although he knows it is wrong, and that '
                 'the news of his marriage must come out soon, he determines '
                 'to enjoy himself with Nancy while he can. Nancy, for her '
                 'part, wants to marry Godfrey, but his strangeness has made '
                 'her cool toward him, and when he asks her forgiveness, she '
                 'says only that she will be glad to see anyone reform. '
                 "Meanwhile Godfrey's wife, Molly, has become determined to "
                 'revenge herself for his treatment of her, and she sets out '
                 'with their child to confront him at the dance. She loses her '
                 'way in the snow, and at last she fortifies herself with '
                 'opium, to which she has become addicted. The opium only '
                 'makes her more drowsy, and Molly sinks down in the snow. Her '
                 'child slips from her arms. It is attracted to a light that '
                 "comes from the open door of Marner's cottage, where the "
                 "weaver stands, unaware of the child's presence. He has been "
                 'looking out to see if his money might return and has been '
                 'stricken by one of his fits. When he awakes, he sees gold by '
                 'his hearth and thinks his money has come back, then he '
                 'discovers that the gold is the hair of a child. At last he '
                 'overcomes his wonder enough to realize that the child has '
                 'come in out of the snow, and there outside he discovers '
                 "Molly's body. Silas takes the child and hurries to Squire "
                 "Cass' house to get the doctor. His entrance causes Godfrey "
                 'both fear and hope because he recognizes the child as his '
                 'own, and he hopes that he may be free at last. He goes with '
                 'Doctor Kimble and finds that the woman Marner found is '
                 'indeed his wife and that she is dead. The woman is buried '
                 'that week, a stranger to everyone but Godfrey. Silas feels '
                 'that the child has been sent to him, and he is determined to '
                 'keep it. This determination causes even warmer feeling for '
                 'him in Raveloe, and he is given much well-meant advice. '
                 'Dolly Winthrop gives him real aid with the child and offers '
                 'some old clothes that belonged to her son Aaron. Godfrey is '
                 'glad enough to have the child cared for. He gives money for '
                 'its support but never claims it as his own. Silas names the '
                 'child Hepzibah — Eppie for short — after his mother and '
                 'little sister. He finds that, unlike his gold, Eppie makes '
                 'him constantly aware of the world and of other men. He gives '
                 'her his wholehearted love, and everywhere he finds kindness '
                 'from the other villagers. Sixteen years pass. Nancy and '
                 'Godfrey are married, and Eppie has grown into a beautiful '
                 'young woman. Silas is liked and respected in Raveloe. His '
                 'life with Eppie has been close and happy, and Mr. and Mrs. '
                 'Cass have done much for them. Dolly Winthrop has become '
                 "Eppie's godmother, and she is a close friend of Silas. The "
                 'two of them have discussed his old problem at Lantern Yard '
                 'and considered the great differences in religion between the '
                 "two places. Now Dolly's son Aaron wishes to marry Eppie, and "
                 'Eppie has agreed — if Silas can live with them. She has been '
                 'told of her mother, but she knows nothing of any other '
                 'father, and she cannot bear to be parted from Silas. Godfrey '
                 'and Nancy, however, are childless. Their one child died in '
                 'infancy. Their childlessness is a great trouble to Godfrey, '
                 'who has always wanted children. At one time he wished to '
                 'adopt Eppie, but Nancy refused, feeling that it would be '
                 'going against Providence to adopt a child when none was '
                 'given naturally. Nancy has tried to make up to Godrey in '
                 'other ways, and their marriage has been happy but for this '
                 'one thing. Godfrey was afraid to tell her that Eppie was his '
                 'own child. On this particular Sunday, Nancy is thinking over '
                 'these old problems when Godfrey becomes very much upset. The '
                 "Stone Pits near Marner's cottage are being drained, and "
                 "Dunstan's body has been found there with Silas' gold. "
                 'Godfrey is forced to tell Nancy that his brother was a '
                 'thief. At the same time, his newfound honesty convinces him '
                 'that all truths come out sooner or later, and he admits that '
                 'Eppie is his own child. Instead of being disgusted with him, '
                 'Nancy is sorry that she refused to adopt Eppie sooner. The '
                 "two of them go that night to Marner's cottage to claim "
                 'Eppie. Eppie, however, does not wish to be claimed. Both she '
                 'and Silas feel that no claim of blood can outweigh their '
                 'years of life together. She does not want to leave Silas nor '
                 'to be rescued from her low station and the prospect of '
                 'marriage to a workingman. At last Godfrey goes home bitterly '
                 'disappointed. He feels that he is being punished now for his '
                 'earlier weakness, but he is determined to try to do his duty '

                 'old theft. He goes there with Eppie, but they find '
                 'everything changed. The chapel is gone, a factory set in its '
                 'place. Only the prison is left to remind Silas that this was '
                 'where he once lived. He returns home no more wise than when '
                 'he set out; but he agrees with Dolly that there is reason to '

                 'Aaron are married on a fine sunny day, with the wedding at '
                 "Mr. Cass' expense. The young couple come to live with Silas "
                 'at his cottage, where the villagers join in agreement that '

{'author': 'Toni Morrison',
 'book_title': 'Song of Solomon',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Song of Solomon explores the quest for cultural identity. '
                 'Based on the African-American folktale about enslaved '
                 'Africans who escape slavery by flying back to Africa, it '
                 'tells the story of Macon "Milkman" Dead, a young man '
                 'alienated from himself and estranged from his family, his '
                 'community, and his historical and cultural roots. Milkman is '
                 'mentally enslaved and spiritually dead, but with the help of '
                 'his eccentric aunt, Pilate, and his best friend, Guitar '
                 'Bains, he embarks on a physical and spiritual journey that '
                 'enables him to reconnect with his past and realize his '
                 'self-worth. The action of Song of Solomon spans thirty-some '
                 'years. The narration comprises two distinct sections. Part I '
                 '(Chapters 1-9) is set in an unnamed town in Michigan — '
                 "presumably Detroit. It traces Milkman's life from birth to "
                 'age thirty-two and focuses on his spiritually empty, aimless '
                 "life as a young man caught between his father's "
                 "materialistic lifestyle and Pilate's traditional values. "
                 "These chapters are interspersed with various characters' "
                 "flashbacks to their pasts. We learn that Milkman's father, "
                 "Macon, and Macon's sister, Pilate, ran away from home after "
                 'their father was murdered for protecting his land. However, '
                 'after a disagreement between them, they each went their own '
                 'way. Although both Macon and Pilate eventually end up in the '
                 'same unnamed Michigan town, Macon refuses to speak to his '
                 'sister, whom he feels is an embarrassment to his social '
                 "position in the town. This section ends with Milkman's "
                 "decision to leave Michigan in search of Pilate's illusory "
                 'gold — Milkman\'s "inheritance" — which Macon is sure his '
                 'sister hid in one of the many places she lived prior to '
                 'coming to Michigan. Part II (Chapters 10-15) begins with '
                 "Milkman's arrival in Danville, Pennsylvania, where his "
                 'paternal grandfather had built the near-mythological '
                 "Lincoln's Heaven, a prosperous farm for which he was killed. "
                 "Unable to find Pilate's gold in Danville and prompted by the "
                 'mysterious stories surrounding his ancestors, Milkman traces '
                 'his ancestry to the fictional town of Shalimar, Virginia, '
                 'where he meets his father\'s "people" and discovers the true '
                 "spiritual meaning of his inheritance. The novel's ambiguous "
                 'ending centers on Milkman\'s "flight" across Solomon\'s '
                 'Leap.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'In August, 1889, Caroline Meeber boards the train at her '
                 'family home in Columbia City and travels to Chicago. Filled '
                 'with fears, tears, and regrets, she is nonetheless '
                 'determined to make her way in the big city. On the long '
                 'train ride she meets a handsome young traveling salesman '
                 'named Charles Drouet. Shy at first, she is warmed and made '
                 "confident by Drouet's easy manner and flashy clothes. He "
                 'seems to her the epitome of wealth and influence. When the '
                 'train arrives in Chicago, she and Drouet make plans to meet '
                 'again the following week so that he can show her the sights '
                 'of the city. Carrie is met at the station by her sister '
                 'Minnie Hanson. The two girls travel to the flat where Minnie '
                 'lives with her husband Sven and their baby. The couple plan '
                 'to have Carrie live with them while she works in the city. '
                 'It is thought that Carrie will pay for her room and board in '
                 'order to help the Hansons reduce expenses. Carrie is '
                 'thrilled by the prospect of finding work in Chicago. She '
                 'imagines herself part of the great swirl of activity in the '
                 'city. Her hopes are somewhat dampened when she finally '
                 'obtains a job in a shoe factory at four and a half dollars a '
                 'week. Carrie realizes that she must abandon some of her more '
                 'ambitious and fantastic plans. The Hansons disapprove of her '
                 'wish to go to the theater. Minnie points out to Carrie that '
                 'after paying four dollars for room and board, she will '
                 'hardly have enough money left for carfare. Because the flat '
                 'is so small, Carrie is unable to invite Drouet to visit. As '
                 'the cold winter sets in, Carrie finds that it is impossible '
                 'to keep up the hard work at the factory. Finally, the '
                 'combination of long hours, hard work, and inadequate '
                 'clothing causes Carrie to become ill and she loses her job. '
                 'The Hansons talk of sending her back to Columbia City, but '
                 'she is determined to remain in Chicago. One day as she '
                 'wanders about downtown looking for a new job, she meets '
                 'Drouet on the street. He buys her a splendid meal and '
                 '"lends" her twenty dollars to buy decent clothes. Eventually '
                 'he persuades Carrie to leave the Hansons and take a room of '
                 'her own, offering to support her until she is settled. Soon '
                 'Carrie and Drouet are living together in a cozy apartment. '
                 'As time passes, Carrie perceives that Drouet is not nearly '
                 'such an ideal figure as she had first imagined. He is '
                 'egotistical and insensitive, but he is also kind and '
                 'generous, and so she accepts her lot graciously. Drouet '
                 'takes it upon himself to "educate" the untutored girl in the '
                 'ways of society, teaching her to Aress and behave according '
                 'to fashion. One evening the young couple are visited by '
                 "George Hurstwood, a friend of Drouet's, the manager of a "
                 '"way up, truly swell saloon." He is mature and attractive; '
                 'he finds Carrie naive and pretty. The two are struck by an '
                 'instantaneous fascination for each other and meet together '
                 'frequently whenever the salesman is out of town. Without '
                 "Carrie's knowledge, Drouet enlists her talents as an actress "
                 'in an amateur performance. To the surprise of Carrie, as '
                 'well as her two admirers, the girl is a brilliant success. '
                 'The next day Hurstwood confesses his love to Carrie and she '
                 'responds favorably. Eventually Drouet discovers that Carrie '
                 'and Hurstwood have been seeing a great deal of each other '
                 'and he moves out of the flat in order to frighten her. '
                 "Hurstwood's wife, meanwhile, a shrewd and selfish woman, "
                 'accuses Hurstwood of having an affair and initiates a '
                 'divorce action against him. One night when he stays late in '
                 'his office to finish some paperwork, Hurstwood discovers '
                 'that the safe has been left unlocked with over ten thousand '
                 'dollars in it. While he is debating with himself whether to '
                 'take the money, the door of the safe slams shut as he holds '
                 'the entire amount in his hands. He is frightened and decides '
                 "to flee. He rushes to Carrie's flat, tells her that Drouet "
                 'has been injured and wishes to see her and whisks her away '
                 'with him on a train to Canada. Carrie is repelled by '
                 'Hurstwood now, for she has learned from Drouet that he is '
                 'married. Hurstwood argues that he has left his wife in order '
                 'to be with Carrie. She believes him and agrees to remain '
                 'with him if he will marry her. In Canada, Hurstwood is '
                 'tracked down by a private detective and returns most of the '
                 'stolen money on the promise that his employers will not '
                 'prosecute. The couple are married in a hasty ceremony, '
                 'although the marriage is not valid. The couple continue on '
                 'to New York, where they find a comfortable apartment. '
                 'Hurstwood is forced to invest the little money he has '
                 'retained in a second-rate saloon. He and Carrie settle down '
                 'to a routine existence in New York, never going out or '
                 'meeting anyone. Carrie strikes up a friendship with her '
                 'neighbor, Mrs. Vance, a young lady of fine manners and '
                 'expensive taste. Through the influence of Mrs. Vance and her '
                 'cousin Bob Ames, Carrie begins to feel dissatisfied with '
                 "being an ordinary housewife. Hurstwood's business venture "
                 'terminates and he finds himself unable to find employment. '
                 'After a while he gives up searching and simply settles back '
                 'to watch his meager savings dwindle. He loses his pride and '
                 'dignity. He hardly ever leaves the house. Conditions become '
                 'so difficult that Carrie decides to find work. She '
                 'eventually finds a part as a chorus girl in a Broadway '
                 'opera. Her fortunes rise steadily after that. Carrie decides '
                 'to leave Hurstwood on his own, for he has become a '
                 'deadweight to her. In a few years Carrie gains fame and '
                 'fortune as a stage comedienne. Hurstwood continues to '
                 'decline until he becomes a Bowery tramp and finally commits '
                 "suicide. At the time of Hurstwood's suicide, Carrie has "
                 'gained all that she had originally hoped for: wealth, '
                 'finery, and prestige. Nevertheless she remains unsatisfied, '
                 'always pondering the vagaries of fortune that make her '
                 'desire something new and indefinable. It is clear that she '
                 'will never gain the happiness she dreams of.',

{'author': 'Hermann Hesse',
 'book_title': 'Steppenwolf',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Steppenwolf begins with a preface narrated by the nephew. '
                 'The nephew meets Harry Haller, or Steppenwolf, when he rents '
                 "rooms at the aunt's boarding house. The nephew dislikes "
                 'Steppenwolf immediately because he seems shy, unsociable, '
                 'and snobbish. The nephew admits that he grows to like '
                 'Steppenwolf after spending time with him and learning about '
                 'his divided nature. He views Steppenwolf as "a genius of '
                 'suffering." The nephew tells the reader that he will present '
                 'Steppenwolf and his story without any commentary, but he '
                 'repeatedly interjects "psychological observation[s]." '
                 'Steppenwolf leaves his manuscript to the nephew, who then '
                 'publishes it. The text, or "Harry Haller\'s Records," is the '
                 'result. The remaining chapters, except for the treatise '
                 'section, are narrated by Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf explains '
                 'his disgust of bourgeois society, as well as his fascination '
                 'with it. He chooses to live among the bourgeoisie even '
                 'though he expresses contempt for them. This is demonstrated '
                 'when he rents rooms from the aunt, just as he has rented '
                 'rooms from countless other bourgeois individuals in the '
                 'past. Steppenwolf describes a typical day for himself. '
                 'Everyday is the same for him now that he is an "old" man in '
                 'his fifties. He reads the paper, reads books, checks the '
                 'mail, and loses himself in the humdrum routine. His '
                 'discontentment with society, his dissatisfaction with his '
                 'own life, and his conviction that he has a divided nature, '
                 'compel him to consider suicide. Later, Steppenwolf sees a '
                 'sign: "MAGIC THEATER. ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY. FOR MADMEN '
                 'ONLY!" A peddler gives Steppenwolf a pamphlet entitled, '
                 '"Treatise on the Steppenwolf." The point of view changes to '
                 'third person within the treatise. The treatise seems to '
                 'describe Harry Haller/Steppenwolf perfectly, even down to '
                 'the names. According to the treatise, Steppenwolf possesses '
                 'two natures — the human and the wolf. The human desires '
                 'order, respect, and responsibility — all elements associated '
                 'with the bourgeoisie. The wolf, on the other hand, only '
                 'desires physical pleasure and physical gratification. It '
                 "doesn't matter how he gets it. Steppenwolf's dualistic "
                 'nature results in constant turmoil since each nature vies '
                 'for control. As a result, Steppenwolf rarely has a moment of '
                 'peace, and he feels isolated from others. The treatise goes '
                 'on to explain that bourgeois society flourishes as a result '
                 'of all the Steppenwolves. The fact that there are many '
                 'Steppenwolves is a given since every individual consists of '
                 'multiple selves. Because society does not accept or '
                 'understand the concept of multiplicity within the self, all '
                 'Steppenwolves are destined to be isolated, rejected, '
                 'misunderstood, and suicidal. The treatise states that '
                 'suicide is not the answer. Steppenwolf compares the '
                 'self-portrait provided by the treatise to a self-portrait he '
                 'has already written in the form of a poem. After '
                 'contemplating both descriptions of himself, he decides to '
                 'commit suicide. Later, he runs into an old acquaintance, the '
                 'professor, who invites him to dinner. Steppenwolf accepts '
                 'the invitation but has a sense of foreboding. At the '
                 "professor's house, he sees a picture of Goethe that repulses "
                 'him. The professor mentions a newspaper article about a '
                 'traitor with the name Harry Haller. Steppenwolf criticizes '
                 'the picture of Goethe, admits that he has lied to the '
                 'professor, and informs the professor that the newspaper '
                 'article is, indeed, about him. He leaves and decides to '
                 'commit suicide when he arrives home. He realizes he is '
                 'afraid of death and even more afraid to kill himself. He '
                 'visits the Black Eagle and meets a young woman sitting at a '
                 'table. She orders him to eat, drink, and sleep. Steppenwolf '
                 'falls asleep and dreams of Goethe, a black scorpion, Mozart, '
                 "and a woman's leg in a box. Goethe tells Steppenwolf that he "
                 'is taking life too seriously. Steppenwolf awakes, and the '
                 'young woman returns to tell Steppenwolf she is leaving with '
                 'someone else. He asks her to dinner, and she accepts. She '
                 "mentions that she understands his reaction to Goethe's "
                 "picture because she does not like artists' renditions of the "
                 'saints. Steppenwolf meets the young woman again, and he '
                 'guesses her name is Hermine. Hermine informs Steppenwolf '
                 'that he will fall in love with her, and she will command him '
                 'to kill her. They discuss the treatise, a newspaper article '
                 'calling him a traitor, and the possibility of another war. '
                 'He purchases a gramophone, and she teaches him the fox-trot. '
                 'He sees Maria for the first time and dances with her. '
                 "Hermine praises Steppenwolf's newly acquired dance skills, "
                 'and she informs him that he needs to have sex with a young '
                 'woman. He protests due to his age, but she dismisses him. He '
                 'discusses music with Pablo, the musician. Later, Steppenwolf '
                 'attends a recital. When he returns to his rooms, he finds '
                 'Maria waiting in bed for him. They begin a sexual '
                 'relationship that lasts for the three weeks leading up to '
                 'the Fancy Dress Ball. Steppenwolf is disappointed that he is '
                 "not Maria's only lover, but he is grateful for her "
                 'attention, and he is grateful to Hermine for arranging the '
                 'affair. Pablo invites Steppenwolf and Maria to participate '
                 'in an orgy, but Steppenwolf refuses. Pablo admits that he '
                 'and Maria are lovers too. Steppenwolf discovers that Hermine '
                 'and Maria discuss their sexual experiences with one another. '
                 'Steppenwolf even suspects that Hermine and Maria could be '
                 'lovers. Hermine reminds Steppenwolf that they will be lovers '
                 'at a later date. Hermine explains that she is a prostitute '
                 'only because her life fell short of her expectations, just '
                 "as Steppenwolf's did. She had envisioned great things for "
                 'herself, but as life turned out, she ended up a courtesan. '
                 'Steppenwolf admits that he is very happy with Maria, but he '
                 'believes the affair is only temporary. He knows that death '
                 'awaits him. Hermine agrees and admits she is waiting for '
                 'death and eternity as well. Steppenwolf stops in a theater '
                 'playing The Ten Commandments while on the way to the ball. '
                 'He arrives at the ball and wanders around looking for '
                 'Hermine. He is just about to leave when he is given a ticket '
                 'with the following scrawled on it: "TONIGHT AT THE MAGIC '
                 'THEATER. FOR MADMEN ONLY. PRICE OF ADMITTANCE YOUR MIND. NOT '
                 'FOR EVERYBODY. HERMINE IS IN HELL." Steppenwolf finds '
                 'Hermine dressed as his old childhood friend Herman. They '
                 'each dance with other women until Steppenwolf falls in love '
                 'with Hermine. Hermine leaves and returns dressed as a '
                 'dancer. The ball ends, and Pablo invites Steppenwolf and '
                 'Hermine into the Magic Theater. Steppenwolf visits several '
                 'galleries in which he relives and edits his past, observes '
                 'his wolf and human natures in contention, murders people in '
                 'a violent battle, and kills Hermine. Mozart appears and '
                 'chastises Steppenwolf for his lack of vision and elitist '
                 'attitude. Mozart informs Steppenwolf that he is no different '
                 'from the bourgeois society he detests, and he explains the '
                 'Steppenwolf is responsible for his own discretions, as well '
                 'as the faults associated with the time period in which he '
                 'lives. Pablo appears, and Steppenwolf learns that he did not '
                 'really murder Hermine.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': '"The Secret Sharer" begins with the anonymous narrator — the '
                 'recently appointed captain of an unnamed ship — anchored in '
                 'the Gulf of Siam (what is now called the Gulf of Thailand). '
                 'As the Captain stands on the deck, alone, he soaks in the '
                 'sunset and silence of the sea. He feels like a stranger to '
                 'his new command, the ship, and his crew. At supper that '
                 'night, the Captain remarks that he saw the masts of a ship '
                 'that must be anchored inside a nearby group of islands. The '
                 'Second Mate tells him that the ship is the Sephora , from '
                 'Liverpool, carrying a cargo of coal. As a goodwill gesture '
                 'toward the crew, who have been working hard the last two '
                 'days, the Captain announces that he will take the anchor '
                 'watch until 1:00 a.m., something usually not done by a '
                 "ship's captain. During the anchor watch, while the hands are "
                 'asleep, the Captain begins to pull in the rope side ladder, '
                 'which was lowered for a tugboat man to come on board and '
                 "deliver the crew's mail. When he begins to pull it in, he "
                 'feels a jerk in the ropes, and surprised, leans over the '
                 'deck to investigate. He sees a naked man in the water, '
                 'holding the bottom of the ladder. The man introduces himself '
                 'as Leggatt, and the Captain fetches him some clothes (one of '
                 'his sleeping suits). Leggatt explains that he was the '
                 "Sephora 's chief mate and that he accidentally killed an "
                 'insolent fellow crewman seven weeks ago. The Captain takes '
                 'him into his stateroom and further learns that Leggatt was '
                 'kept under arrest in his cabin until he escaped and swam to '
                 'the rope ladder where the Captain discovered him. He sank '
                 "his clothes so the Sephora 's crew would think he had "
                 'committed suicide by drowning. The Captain feels an '
                 'unexplainable affinity to Leggatt, often referring to him as '
                 '"my double" or "second self." The Captain tells Leggatt that '
                 'he has only been in charge for two weeks and feels as much '
                 'of a stranger on the ship as Leggatt himself. He agrees to '
                 "hide Leggatt in his stateroom. The Sephora 's captain soon "
                 'arrives in his search for the escaped murderer. He searches '
                 'the ship, but Leggatt remains hidden, thanks to the '
                 "maneuverings of the Captain. The Sephora 's captain states "
                 'that he will have to report Leggatt as a suicide when his '
                 'ship arrives home. The Captain and Leggatt share their '
                 "relief at not having been caught. As the Captain's ship "
                 'begins its voyage home, the Captain grows more nervous about '
                 'the possibility of the crew discovering Leggatt on board. On '
                 'the fourth day out, the steward almost stumbles upon Leggatt '
                 "when he delivers the Captain's coat to his stateroom. "
                 'Leggatt tells the Captain that he must maroon him amongst '
                 'some islands, because he knows he cannot return to England '
                 'and face prison or the gallows. The Captain reluctantly '
                 'agrees. As the ship approaches Koh-ring, an island, the '
                 'Captain orders the crew to steer the ship close to the '
                 'shore. They protest that such a move is unsafe, but the '
                 'Captain is determined to give Leggatt a chance to swim to '
                 'safety. After stealing away to his stateroom and shaking '
                 "Leggatt's hand, the Captain continues to have the ship "
                 'steered close to the shore, despite all the protests of his '
                 'terrified crew. Leggatt jumps off the deck and swims to '
                 'safety, the Captain successfully maneuvers the ship out of '

 'summary_text': 'In 1429 A.D., a young country girl known simply as Joan of '
                 'Arc, or sometimes simply as The Maid, is given an interview '
                 'by Robert de Baudricourt since she will not leave until she '
                 'speaks with him. She tells him that she needs horses and '
                 'armor to go to the Dauphin of France and to raise the siege '
                 'of Orleans, a city held captive by the English forces. She '
                 'knows that a siege would be possible because the voices of '
                 'Saints Margaret and Catherine have told her what to do. Upon '
                 "being convinced by The Maid's simplicity, Captain de "
                 'Baudricourt grants her request. Upon arriving at the '
                 "Dauphin's castle, The Maid encounters all sorts of "
                 'difficulties, especially with the Dauphin, who wants nothing '
                 "to do with wars and fighting. When France's military "
                 "fortunes and predicament are reviewed, Joan's demands that "
                 "something be done to improve France's condition fall on deaf "
                 'ears, but when she is alone with the Dauphin, she is able to '
                 'instill enough courage in him so that he finally consents to '
                 "let her lead the army, knowing full well that she can't make "
                 "France's condition worse. Joan then goes to the Loire River "
                 'near Orleans, where she encounters Dunois, the commander of '
                 'the French forces; he explains the necessity of waiting '
                 'until the wind changes, but Joan is determined to lead her '
                 'forces against the English stronghold without waiting; '
                 'suddenly, the wind does change favorably, and Dunois pledges '
                 'his allegiance to The Maid. Sometime later, in the English '
                 'camp, Warwick, the leader of the English forces, and his '
                 'chaplain, de Stogumber, are maintaining that The Maid must '
                 'be a witch because there is no other way of accounting for '
                 'the heavy English losses and defeats except by sorcery. The '
                 'Bishop of Beauvais, Peter Cauchon, enters and discusses the '
                 "fate of Joan of Arc. Cauchon's principal intellectual "
                 'concern is that Joan is setting up her own private '
                 'conscience in place of the authority of the Church. Warwick, '
                 'who is not influenced by the concerns of the Church, is, '
                 'instead, concerned that Joan is telling the common people '
                 'and the serfs to pledge their allegiance directly to the '
                 'king, whereas the entire feudal system is based upon the '
                 'lower classes pledging their allegiance to their immediate '
                 "lords and masters. Joan's simple pleas can possibly destroy "
                 'the entire feudal system. Cauchon also adds that Joan is '
                 'trying to get the common people to pledge further allegiance '
                 'to their native countries (France and England) instead of to '
                 'the Universal Catholic Church, an act which would further '
                 'lessen the power of the Church. Thus, for different reasons, '
                 'both agree that The Maid must be put to death. After more '
                 'victories, Joan has finally been able to fulfill her promise '
                 'to drive the English back and have the Dauphin crowned king '
                 'in the Cathedral at Rheims. After the ceremony, Joan is '
                 'anxious to move on and capture Paris and drive the English '
                 'from the city. The Dauphin, however, is content now with '
                 'what he has recaptured, Commander Dunois is hesitant to '
                 'start another campaign after all of the recent successes, '
                 'and the Archbishop is beginning to find Joan to be too proud '
                 'and defiant. Joan then realizes that she must stand alone in '
                 'the same way that "saints have always stood alone," and in '
                 "spite of the warning that if she falls into the enemy's "
                 'hands, neither the military, nor the state, nor the Church '
                 'will lift a hand to rescue her. Some nine months later, Joan '
                 'is standing trial for heresy. She has been imprisoned and in '
                 'chains for these nine months and has been questioned many '
                 'times about the validity of her "voices." After many '
                 'complicated theological questions, her accusers force Joan '
                 'to admit that her voices were not heavenly sent voices but, '
                 'instead, came from Satan. After her recantation of the '
                 'voices, her judges then sentence her to perpetual '
                 'imprisonment and isolation, living off only bread and water. '
                 'Joan rejects this horrid punishment and tears up her '
                 'recantation. She is immediately carried to the stake and '
                 'burnt as a witch; afterward, the Executioner enters and '
                 "announces that Joan's heart would not burn. Some twenty-five "
                 'years later, in an Epilogue, Joan reappears before the king '
                 '(the former Dauphin) and her chief accusers, who have now '
                 'been condemned by a subsequent court, which has pronounced '
                 'Joan innocent of all charges and her judges guilty of all '
                 'sorts of crimes. The time then moves to 1920, when Joan is '
                 'declared to be a saint by the Church. As such, she now has '
                 'the power to return as a living woman, and she asks everyone '
                 'present if she should return. This is a horrifying prospect '
                 'for them all, and they all confess that they wish her to '
                 'remain dead. Joan then asks of God, "O Lord, how long before '
                 'the world will be ready to accept its saints?"',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Sound and the Fury is a dramatic presentation of the '
                 'decline of the once-aristocratic Compson family of '
                 'Yoknapatawpha County, in northern Mississippi. Divided into '
                 'four sections, the history is narrated by three Compson '
                 'brothers — Benjamin, Quentin, and Jason — followed by a '
                 'section by an omniscient narrator. Section One is seen '
                 'through the sensitivities of Benjamin (Benjy), Compson, on '
                 'April 7, 1928, when Benjy is thirty-three years old. The '
                 'youngest of the Compson children, Benjy was christened Maury '
                 'in honor of his uncle, but by the time he reached the age of '
                 'five, it became apparent that he was retarded. Out of the '
                 "family's respect for his namesake, he was thereafter called "
                 'Benjy. The eight scenes that comprise the Benjy section jump '
                 'about in time, from one of his earliest memories (when, in '
                 'fact, he was still called Maury) and extend to the present '
                 '(1928). Because of his impaired mental facilities, Benjy is '
                 'literal, simplistic, and sensual. This section of the novel '
                 'centers on his impressions of his sister Candace (Caddy), '
                 'the only one in his family who was truly solicitous of him, '
                 'and arguably one of the most significant characters in the '
                 "novel. Benjy's earliest depicted memory, from 1898 (when he "
                 "was three years old), establishes the essence of Caddy's "
                 'character. This early appearance of Caddy introduces two '
                 "major themes — Caddy's mud-soiled underwear, and water — "
                 'that will replay through the novel. The Compson children are '
                 'ignorant of the death of their grandmother. Caddy is the '
                 'only one of the Compson children brave enough to climb the '
                 'pear tree and look through the window to "spy" on the '
                 'visitors who have come to attend what she realizes is the '
                 'funeral wake. While Caddy does this, her brothers stand '
                 'below, gazing up at her muddy underwear, which were soiled '
                 'earlier when they were playing in a creek adjoining the '
                 'Compson estate. Faulkner uses the muddy underwear as an '
                 "emblem of Caddy's incipient sexuality; he frequently "
                 'introduces bathing scenes in which water is used as a '
                 "cleansing and purifying agent. Many of Benjy's other "
                 'memories focus on Caddy, including when she uses perfume '
                 '(1905), when she loses her virginity (1909), and her wedding '
                 '(1910). Benjy also has impressions of his name change (from '
                 "Maury to Benjamin) in 1900, his brother Quentin's suicide in "
                 '1910, and the horrific sequence of events at the gate that '
                 'lead to his being castrated, also in 1910. Section Two is '
                 "seen from Quentin Compson's mind on June 2, 1910, the day he "
                 'prepares for and eventually commits suicide. Alone in his '
                 'regard for the illustrious history and tradition of the '
                 "Compson family, Quentin's reflections on time introduce "
                 'another significant theme. Just as Benjy did, Quentin '
                 'reflects on Caddy, her emerging sexuality, and the '
                 'mortification he experiences at the implications of her '
                 'unwed pregnancy. In many ways, Quentin represents pre–Civil '
                 'War views of honor, Southern womanhood, and virginity. He '
                 "cannot accept his sister's growing sexuality, just as he "
                 'cannot accept his father\'s notion that "virginity" is '
                 "merely an invention by men. Just as many of Benjy's "
                 "flashbacks directly concern his involvement in Caddy's "
                 "sexual maturation, so do Quentin's. The flashbacks dramatize "
                 'just how ineffectual Quentin is in his dealings with his '
                 'family, his Harvard studies, and his belief that the '
                 'Compsons can return to their earlier days of Southern '
                 'tradition. Section Three is told by the third Compson '
                 'brother, Jason, a day before Benjy, on Good Friday, April 6, '
                 '1928. Unlike his brothers, Jason is much more focused on the '
                 'present, offering fewer flashbacks — though he does have a '
                 'few, and he refers frequently to events in the past. The '
                 "tone of Jason's section is set instantly by the opening "
                 'sentence: "Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say." A '
                 'redneck and a sadist, Jason serves to demonstrate how low '
                 'the Compson family has descended from its former stature, '
                 "specifically illustrated in the comparison between Quentin's "
                 "obsessions over heritage, honor, and sin to Jason's "
                 'near-constant cruelty, complaints, and scheming. Also '
                 'present in this section is another ironic comparison: In '
                 "residence in the Compson home is another Quentin, Caddy's "
                 'daughter, who appears to be heading in the same direction of '
                 'sexual freedom as her mother. Jason is, in his way, as '
                 "preoccupied with young Quentin's emerging sexuality as his "
                 "brother Quentin was with Caddy's. Among the surprises and "
                 'revelations in this section: Quentin drowned himself (the '
                 "suicide itself was not depicted in Quentin's section); Benjy "
                 'is brutally castrated to prevent him from fathering any '
                 'impaired children"; Caddy has been divorced. Banished from '
                 'the family home, she has taken up residence in a neighboring '
                 'county and has been sending money to her daughter. Because '
                 "Mrs. Compson has forbidden Caddy's name from being mentioned "
                 'in the house, she has likewise forbidden her money from '
                 'entering the house. To overcome this hurdle, Jason forges '
                 "copies of Caddy's checks sent to cover expenses and treats "
                 'for Miss Quentin. Jason gives his mother the forgeries, '
                 'which Mrs. Compson ceremoniously burns. Meanwhile, Jason '
                 'cashes the actual checks and pockets the money, giving '
                 'little or none of it to his niece. Section Four has an '
                 'omniscient or authorial viewpoint. The time is the present, '
                 'which, in terms of the novel, is Easter Sunday, April 8, '
                 '1928. All traces of Caddy, including her daughter and even '
                 'the very mention of her name, have been removed. Jason '
                 'pursues his niece, Miss Quentin, who has discovered his '
                 'ongoing use of the money sent for her support and has '
                 'managed to steal $7,000 from him. Jason pursues her, hopeful '
                 'of recovering some of the money she has taken from him. The '
                 'section is sometimes referred to as "Dilsey\'s Section" '
                 'after Dilsey Gibson, matriarch of the black family that has '
                 'served the Compsons over the years, because of her '
                 'prominence in this section. The Dilsey Section focuses on '
                 "Dilsey's attendance at an Easter church service, at which a "
                 'preacher from St. Louis, Reverend Shegog, delivers a sermon '
                 'that stirs in Dilsey an epiphany of doom for the Compson '
                 'family. After the sermon, Dilsey says, "I\'ve seed de first '
                 'en de last . . . I seed de beginnin, en now I sees de '
                 'endin." In this omniscient fourth section of the novel, the '
                 'two narrative lines of Benjy and Jason converge to produce '
                 'the ending when the two brothers meet outside the town hall '
                 "and Benjy experiences a sense of elation he'd first known "
                 'when he was only three — a time when everything seemed '
                 'returned to its proper order.',

 'summary_text': 'Chapter I of The Sun Also Rises introduces us to the '
                 'novelist Robert Cohn, a graduate of Princeton University who '
                 'married a wealthy woman and founded a literary journal soon '
                 "after college. When Cohn's wife left him, he became involved "
                 'with a woman named Frances Clyne, and they traveled together '
                 "to Paris, where they are living at the start of the novel's "
                 "action. It is the mid-1920's. Cohn visits the story's "
                 'narrator and main character, Jake Barnes, in the Paris '
                 'offices of the newspaper for which Jake works. Later, Jake '
                 'picks up a prostitute named Georgette, and the two of them '
                 'join a group including Cohn, Frances, and some others. The '
                 'group goes dancing at a nightclub, where a woman named Brett '
                 '(also known as Lady Ashley, because she is, by marriage, a '
                 'titled British aristocrat) appears. Cohn is attracted to '
                 'Brett, but she leaves the club with Jake. Jake tries to kiss '
                 'Brett, but she withdraws, telling him that although she '
                 'loves him, she "can\'t stand it." (Apparently, Jake has been '
                 'castrated in combat during the Great War and cannot '
                 'consummate his love for Brett.) They rejoin their friends '
                 'and are joined in turn by a Greek Count named Mippipopolous '
                 'before Jake returns to his apartment, where he lies in bed, '
                 'drunk and miserable. The next day, Cohn speculates that he '
                 'may be in love with Brett, and Frances tells Jake that she '
                 'believes Cohn plans to break up with her. When Brett and the '
                 "Count visit Jake's apartment, Jake tells Brett he loves her "
                 'and asks if they can live together. She replies that doing '
                 'so is impossible because she would be tempted to cheat on '
                 'him. She also tells him that she is about to travel to San '
                 'Sebastian, a coastal town in the Basque region of Spain. '
                 'Later, Brett admits to Jake that she feels miserable, '
                 'apparently due to her unfulfilled love for him. Jake '
                 'receives a postcard from Brett in San Sebastian, as well as '
                 "a note from Cohn saying that he's leaving the country for a "
                 'while; it is rumored that Frances has gone to England. '
                 "Jake's friend Bill Gorton visits Paris, severely "
                 'intoxicated. They are joined by Brett, back from San '
                 'Sebastian, and Mike Campbell, her fiancé. Mike, too, is '
                 'falling-down drunk. Jake writes to Robert Cohn in Spain to '
                 'say that he and Bill will meet Cohn at Bayonne (near the '
                 'French-Spanish border) to go fishing together near the '
                 'Spanish village of Burguete. Mike invites himself and Brett '
                 'along, and they arrange to rendezvous in the nearby town of '
                 'Pamplona. Then Brett reveals to Jake that Cohn was with her '
                 'in San Sebastian. Jake and Bill depart Paris via rail and '
                 'arrive in Bayonne in the evening. The next morning, Jake, '
                 'Bill, and Cohn travel to Pamplona; however, Brett and Mike '
                 'are not on the train they were scheduled to take. The '
                 'following day, Jake and Bill go fishing as planned. Cohn has '
                 'announced his decision to remain in Pamplona. For five days, '
                 'Jake and Bill hear nothing from Cohn, Brett, or Mike. While '
                 'fishing, they befriend an Englishman named Harris. After '
                 'receiving telegrams from both Mike and Cohn, however, Jake '
                 'and Bill return to Pamplona. There they meet up with Brett, '
                 'Mike, and Cohn before walking to the corrals outside of town '
                 'to see the unloading of the bulls for the coming bullfights. '
                 'At a café afterward, Mike browbeats Cohn for tagging after '
                 'Brett. Apparently, Cohn returned to San Sebastian while Jake '
                 "and Bill were fishing in Burguete. Pamplona's yearly fiesta "
                 'of San Fermin, which will last for seven days, begins. '
                 'Musicians and dancers fill the streets and shops — including '
                 'the wine store, where Brett is placed on a cask so the '
                 'Basque peasants can dance around her as if she were a pagan '
                 'idol. Jake sleeps while his friends stay out all night and '
                 'then attend the running of the bulls from the corrals to the '
                 'bullring, through the streets of town. Jake meets the '
                 '19-year-old matador Pedro Romero, and the next day, after '
                 'Romero performs admirably in the ring, Brett cannot help '
                 'talking about her attraction to him. The hotelier Montoya '
                 'visits Jake to express his concern that mixing with rich '
                 'tourists will corrupt Romero. Later, at dinner, Brett '
                 'invites the bullfighter to her table. Montoya looks on with '
                 'disapproval. Once again, Mike picks on Cohn. Brett too '
                 'lashes out at him, then tells Jake that she feels guilty for '
                 'having slept with Cohn while engaged to Mike. She asks Jake '
                 'if he loves her, and when Jake says that he does, Brett says '
                 'she is in love with Romero. So Jake helps Brett find the '
                 'matador in a café, where they flirt openly. Jake leaves; '
                 'when he returns, the two are gone. Later, Cohn calls Jake a '
                 'pimp, and in the ensuing fistfight, Jake is beaten up. The '
                 "next day, Mike reports that Cohn found Brett in Romero's "
                 'room and beat the bullfighter up, too, after which Cohn '
                 "cried. Mike admits that he is upset by his fiancée's "
                 'promiscuity. On the last day of the fiesta, Cohn has left '
                 'town, presumably to return to Frances. Jake and Brett pray '
                 'at the Pamplona cathedral before she visits Romero. Then '
                 'Jake, Brett, and Bill attend the bullfight, in which Romero, '
                 'beloved of the crowd, performs spectacularly. Brett leaves '
                 'town also, in the company of the matador. The rest of the '
                 'group splits up. Jake travels to San Sebastian, where he '

 'book_title': 'The Scarlet Letter',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'In June 1642, in the Puritan town of Boston, a crowd gathers '
                 'to witness an official punishment. A young woman, Hester '
                 'Prynne, has been found guilty of adultery and must wear a '
                 'scarlet A on her dress as a sign of shame. Furthermore, she '
                 'must stand on the scaffold for three hours, exposed to '
                 'public humiliation. As Hester approaches the scaffold, many '
                 'of the women in the crowd are angered by her beauty and '
                 'quiet dignity. When demanded and cajoled to name the father '
                 'of her child, Hester refuses. As Hester looks out over the '
                 'crowd, she notices a small, misshapen man and recognizes him '
                 'as her long-lost husband, who has been presumed lost at sea. '
                 "When the husband sees Hester's shame, he asks a man in the "
                 "crowd about her and is told the story of his wife's "
                 "adultery. He angrily exclaims that the child's father, the "
                 'partner in the adulterous act, should also be punished and '
                 'vows to find the man. He chooses a new name — Roger '
                 'Chillingworth — to aid him in his plan. Reverend John Wilson '
                 'and the minister of her church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question '
                 'Hester, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns '
                 'to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger '
                 'Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child '
                 'with his roots and herbs. Dismissing the jailer, '
                 "Chillingworth first treats Pearl, Hester's baby, and then "
                 "demands to know the name of the child's father. When Hester "
                 'refuses, he insists that she never reveal that he is her '
                 'husband. If she ever does so, he warns her, he will destroy '
                 "the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms "
                 'even though she suspects she will regret it. Following her '
                 'release from prison, Hester settles in a cottage at the edge '
                 'of town and earns a meager living with her needlework. She '
                 'lives a quiet, somber life with her daughter, Pearl. She is '
                 "troubled by her daughter's unusual character. As an infant, "
                 'Pearl is fascinated by the scarlet A . As she grows older, '
                 'Pearl becomes capricious and unruly. Her conduct starts '
                 'rumors, and, not surprisingly, the church members suggest '
                 'Pearl be taken away from Hester. Hester, hearing the rumors '
                 'that she may lose Pearl, goes to speak to Governor '
                 'Bellingham. With him are Reverends Wilson and Dimmesdale. '
                 'When Wilson questions Pearl about her catechism, she refuses '
                 'to answer, even though she knows the correct response, thus '
                 'jeopardizing her guardianship. Hester appeals to Reverend '
                 'Dimmesdale in desperation, and the minister persuades the '
                 "governor to let Pearl remain in Hester's care. Because "
                 "Reverend Dimmesdale's health has begun to fail, the "
                 'townspeople are happy to have Chillingworth, a newly arrived '
                 'physician, take up lodgings with their beloved minister. '
                 'Being in such close contact with Dimmesdale, Chillingworth '
                 "begins to suspect that the minister's illness is the result "
                 'of some unconfessed guilt. He applies psychological pressure '
                 "to the minister because he suspects Dimmesdale to be Pearl's "
                 "father. One evening, pulling the sleeping Dimmesdale's "
                 'vestment aside, Chillingworth sees something startling on '
                 "the sleeping minister's pale chest: a scarlet A . Tormented "
                 'by his guilty conscience, Dimmesdale goes to the square '
                 'where Hester was punished years earlier. Climbing the '
                 'scaffold, he sees Hester and Pearl and calls to them to join '
                 'him. He admits his guilt to them but cannot find the courage '
                 'to do so publicly. Suddenly Dimmesdale sees a meteor forming '
                 'what appears to be a gigantic A in the sky; simultaneously, '
                 'Pearl points toward the shadowy figure of Roger '
                 "Chillingworth. Hester, shocked by Dimmesdale's "
                 'deterioration, decides to obtain a release from her vow of '
                 'silence to her husband. In her discussion of this with '
                 'Chillingworth, she tells him his obsession with revenge must '
                 'be stopped in order to save his own soul. Several days '
                 'later, Hester meets Dimmesdale in the forest, where she '
                 'removes the scarlet letter from her dress and identifies her '
                 'husband and his desire for revenge. In this conversation, '
                 'she convinces Dimmesdale to leave Boston in secret on a ship '
                 'to Europe where they can start life anew. Renewed by this '
                 'plan, the minister seems to gain new energy. Pearl, however, '
                 'refuses to acknowledge either of them until Hester replaces '
                 'her symbol of shame on her dress. Returning to town, '
                 'Dimmesdale loses heart in their plan: He has become a '
                 'changed man and knows he is dying. Meanwhile, Hester is '
                 'informed by the captain of the ship on which she arranged '
                 'passage that Roger Chillingworth will also be a passenger. '
                 'On Election Day, Dimmesdale gives what is declared to be one '
                 'of his most inspired sermons. But as the procession leaves '
                 'the church, Dimmesdale stumbles and almost falls. Seeing '
                 'Hester and Pearl in the crowd watching the parade, he climbs '
                 "upon the scaffold and confesses his sin, dying in Hester's "
                 'arms. Later, witnesses swear that they saw a stigmata in the '
                 'form of a scarlet A upon his chest. Chillingworth, losing '
                 'his revenge, dies shortly thereafter and leaves Pearl a '
                 'great deal of money, enabling her to go to Europe with her '
                 'mother and make a wealthy marriage. Several years later, '
                 'Hester returns to Boston, resumes wearing the scarlet '
                 'letter, and becomes a person to whom other women turn for '
                 'solace. When she dies, she is buried near the grave of '
                 'Dimmesdale, and they share a simple slate tombstone with the '
                 'inscription "On a field, sable, the letter A gules."',

 'summary_text': "Madame Pernelle, visiting her son Orgon's house, uses the "
                 'opportunity to criticize all the members of the house and to '
                 'praise their boarder, Tartuffe, because he is a man of such '
                 'holiness and zeal. The others present offer objections to '
                 'Tartuffe, maintaining that he is false and hypocritical, but '
                 'Madame Pernelle will not entertain such thoughts. As she '
                 "leaves, she admonishes everyone to follow Tartuffe's "
                 "precepts. After Madame Pernelle's departure, Cléante and "
                 'Dorine talk about Tartuffe and both agree that he has '
                 "beguiled Orgon. Damis, Orgon's son, wonders whether his "
                 'father will still allow Mariane to marry Valère; Damis must '
                 "know Orgon's feelings because he wants to marry Valère's "
                 'sister. He asks Cléante to question Orgon about his promise '
                 'to allow the marriage to take place. Orgon arrives and seems '
                 'much more concerned about the welfare of Tartuffe than he is '
                 "about his wife's illness. Cléante tries to discuss Tartuffe "
                 'with Orgon, but fails and discovers that Orgon is only '
                 "interested in singing Tartuffe's praises. When Orgon is "
                 'questioned about the intended wedding, he dodges the issues '
                 'and refuses to give a direct answer. When his daughter '
                 'arrives, Orgon tells her that he wants to ally Tartuffe with '
                 "his house; this he can best do by Mariane's marrying "
                 'Tartuffe. Mariane is so shocked that she cannot believe her '
                 'ears. After Orgon departs, Dorine, the maid, reprimands '
                 "Mariane for not having refused to marry Tartuffe. Mariane's "
                 'beloved, Valère, arrives and accuses her of consenting to '
                 'the marriage. Dorine listens to them argue and then, after '
                 'they are reconciled, she promises to help them expose '
                 "Tartuffe's hypocrisy. Damis, incensed about Tartuffe, is "
                 "also determined to reveal Tartuffe's hypocrisy, and, as he "
                 "hears Tartuffe's approach, he hides in the closet. Elmire, "
                 "Orgon's wife, arrives and Tartuffe, thinking that they are "
                 'alone, makes some professions of love to Elmire and suggests '
                 'that they become lovers. Having heard Tartuffe make such a '
                 'proposition, Damis reveals himself and threatens to expose '
                 'Tartuffe. When Orgon arrives, Damis tries to inform his '
                 "father about Tartuffe's proposition, but Orgon is so blind "
                 'that he thinks his own son is evil in trying to defame '
                 "Tartuffe's good name and he immediately disinherits his son. "
                 'Alone with Tartuffe, Orgon reveals that he plans to make '
                 'Tartuffe his sole heir and also his son-in-law. They leave '
                 'to execute this plan. Cléante later confronts Tartuffe and '
                 'tries to reason with him, but Tartuffe will only respond in '
                 'religious clichés, and as soon as the opportunity presents '
                 'itself, he hastily excuses himself from the room. Orgon and '
                 "Elmire arrive, and when she hears Orgon's plans, she "
                 'extracts a promise from him to hide in some concealed place '
                 "and observe Tartuffe's actions. Orgon consents and Elmire "
                 'sends for Tartuffe. When he arrives, he is accosted by '
                 'Elmire, and soon he begins to make not only his declarations '
                 'of love to Elmire but also derogatory comments about Orgon. '
                 "Finally convinced of Tartuffe's hypocrisy, Orgon emerges and "
                 'orders him from the household. Tartuffe then reveals that '
                 'legally he is now the owner of the house, since Orgon has '
                 'signed over all his property. Alone with his wife, Orgon '
                 'reveals that he is frightened because, earlier, he had '
                 "entrusted some secret documents to Tartuffe's care — "
                 "documents which could ruin Orgon's trusted position in the "
                 "court. When Orgon's mother arrives, he cannot convince her "

                 'that Tartuffe is having the entire family evicted that '
                 'Madame Pernelle is convinced. Tartuffe brings with him '
                 'officers of the court, but, as the family is about to be '
                 'evicted, the officer reveals that the king has seen through '
                 'the hypocrisy of Tartuffe and has ordered him to be '
                 'imprisoned for this and for other crimes. The king has also '
                 'restored to Orgon all of his rightful property.',

 'summary_text': 'The Taming of the Shrew opens with an Induction. Here we '
                 'meet Christopher Sly, a tinker by trade and a drunk by '
                 'avocation. As the action opens, he is being thrown out of an '
                 "alehouse. Drunken, he falls asleep before a nearby Lord's "
                 'house. When the Lord returns from hunting, he spies Sly and '
                 'immediately concocts a plan to convince the beggar that he '
                 'is a nobleman. The Lord orders Sly to be taken into the '
                 "house, bathed, and placed in the estate's nicest bed. He "
                 'also orders his servants to wait on Sly and treat him as if '
                 'he were the lord of the manor. In the midst of this merry '
                 'planning, a troupe of actors appears and is enlisted for a '
                 'performance that evening. Upon waking, Christopher Sly is '
                 'understandably confused. He immediately calls for a drink '
                 'and is attended to by three servants (supposedly his). The '
                 'Lord himself assumes a subordinate position and takes great '
                 "delight at Sly's consternation at the situation. Before "
                 "long, Sly falls into the Lord's trap and believes he is, in "
                 'fact, master of all he surveys. The Lord and his servants, '
                 "though, have a laugh at Sly's expense. When Sly requests his "
                 'wife join him in bed, he is told that the doctors have '
                 'warned that sexual activity may cause a relapse, and so '
                 'rather than risk returning to his beggarly self, he agrees '
                 'to wait, opting instead to watch the play put on by the '
                 'acting company. The story of The Taming of the Shrew itself '
                 'really begins at this point. As Act I opens, we meet '
                 'Lucentio, a young man who has traveled to Padua from '
                 'Florence. His servant Tranio accompanies him, and together '
                 'they secretly witness quite a scene. Before them enters '
                 'Baptista Minola, his daughters Katherine and Bianca, and two '
                 'men, Gremio and Hortensio, both wishing to be suitors to '
                 'Bianca. Minola explains, however, that no one shall court '
                 'Bianca until her older sister is successfully married. The '
                 'problem, as the two men point out, is that Kate is so '
                 'forward and unruly that no one they can think of would '
                 'possibly want to marry her. Baptista declares he will allow '
                 'tutors into his house, but no suitors until Kate is wed. '
                 'After Minola and his entourage leave, Lucentio reveals he '
                 'has fallen utterly in love with Bianca. Because he knows her '
                 'father will admit no suitors, he decides to disguise himself '
                 'as a schoolmaster and secretly court Bianca. Because '
                 'Lucentio is expected in Padua and his absence would be '
                 'noted, he instructs his servant Tranio to assume his '
                 'persona. Shortly Petruchio, a gentleman from Verona, and his '
                 'servant Grumio arrive. Petruchio has come seeking his '
                 'fortune in the form of a wealthy wife. His friend, '
                 'Hortensio, informs him he knows just the woman, but the '
                 "drawback is she is a shrew. Petruchio doesn't care. He's "
                 'sure he can handle the most unruly woman so long as her '
                 "dowry is ample. Before the two men venture to Minola's house "
                 'to meet Kate and her father, Hortensio asks Petruchio to '
                 'presented him to old Baptista as a schoolmaster so he can '
                 'court Bianca privately. Petruchio agrees and, on their way '
                 "to Minola's, they meet Gremio who has agreed to present "
                 'Lucentio (whom he thinks is really Cambio, a tutor who will '
                 'speak to Bianca on his behalf) to Baptista. Finally, Tranio '
                 '(disguised as Lucentio), who also wishes to become one of '
                 "Bianca's suitors, joins the group. As the second act opens, "
                 'Kate enters dragging her sister, providing spectators with a '
                 'peek at what fuels her anger and spite: Bianca is clearly '
                 'the more favored daughter, and Kate resents it. Soon '
                 'Baptista enters, and the girls leave. The bevy of suitors '
                 'arrives, and all men begin to explain their purpose in '
                 'calling on Minola. He accepts the gifts of tutors and sends '
                 "them in the house to begin work. He then discusses Kate's "
                 'dowry with Petruchio and ends by claiming that, when he has '
                 "won her love, then he may marry her. Petruchio and Kate's "
                 'initial meeting features an embittered and passionate volley '
                 'of insults and slurs, each person meeting the linguistic '
                 'challenges posited by the other. Petruchio remains undaunted '
                 "despite Kate's vehement denial of his advances and insists "
                 'they will be married on Sunday. In order to save face in '
                 "front of his peers (after all, Kate's putting up a valiant "
                 'struggle against him), Petruchio explains that Kate is '
                 "gentle as a lamb in private, but they've agreed she will be "
                 'shrewd and curst in public. Baptista, satisfied that his '
                 'eldest daughter has been won, turns his attention to the '
                 'marriage of his younger daughter, choosing Tranio (Lucentio) '
                 "as Bianca's groom, provided he can produce proof of the "
                 'wealth he claims to have. Lucentio and Hortensio, disguised '
                 'as Cambio and Litio respectively, continue their attempts to '
                 'woo Bianca as they pretend to instruct her. She clearly '
                 'prefers Lucentio, although she is cautious in her judgment. '
                 "Kate's wedding day approaches, and all the arrangements are "
                 'made. However, one thing is missing: the groom. When the '
                 'wedding party waits at the church, wondering if Petruchio '
                 'will show, Kate is visibly disappointed. When Petruchio '
                 'finally arrives, he is dressed inappropriately, purposely '
                 'causing an uproar in his subtle attempt to mirror the '
                 'senseless bad behavior of his wife-to-be. After the wedding '
                 'ceremony, Petruchio insists he and Katherine head back to '
                 'his house immediately, forcing her to miss their own wedding '
                 "reception. When the newlyweds arrive at Petruchio's house, "
                 'we hear that they fought the entire way. Upon arriving, Kate '
                 'is denied food or sleep all under the guise of Petruchio '
                 'taking especial care of her (no food is good enough nor bed '
                 "fit enough). Back at Baptista's house, Hortensio is "
                 'beginning to realize that Bianca may, in fact, favor his '
                 'rival, Cambio (the real Lucentio). In his anger, he '
                 'renounces his pursuit of Bianca and vows to marry a rich '
                 'widow. He leaves as Tranio enters, informing the lovers of '
                 'the new development. In order to expedite the marriage of '
                 'Lucentio and Bianca, though, Tranio needs to find someone to '
                 "impersonate Vincentio, Lucentio's father, in order to "
                 "confirm Lucentio's riches. A Pedant approaches and is soon "
                 'convinced that it would be in his best interest to '
                 'impersonate Vincentio. Later he will meet with Baptista and '
                 'convince him that Lucentio (Tranio) is his son and that he '
                 'does, indeed, possess the riches he claims. When Baptista '
                 'agrees to the marriage, Biondello informs Cambio (the real '
                 'Lucentio), and a secret marriage between Bianca and the real '
                 "Lucentio is arranged. Back at Petruchio's house, Kate is "
                 "beginning to lose patience with her husband's seemingly "
                 'erratic behavior. After his friend Hortensio arrives, '
                 'Petruchio finally provides Kate with some food but threatens '
                 "to remove it if she doesn't thank him properly for providing "
                 'it. Later he proclaims they will return to Padua dressed in '
                 'the finest array but then rejects the goods of the '
                 'haberdasher and tailor who were to dress them for their '
                 'journey. As the party prepares to leave, Petruchio again '
                 'turns tables on Kate, claiming (purposely in error) that it '
                 'will be noon when they arrive. When she corrects him '
                 '(rightly), he calls the trip off until such a time as she '
                 'obeys what he says. Once they finally get underway, '
                 'Petruchio still holds fast to his power. He claims the sun '
                 'is the moon and refuses to let the travelling party continue '
                 'until Kate agrees with him. She begins to see how '
                 "Petruchio's system works: If she agrees with him, she gets "
                 'something she wants. She is tested when Petruchio calls an '
                 'old man (the real Vincentio) a young woman. Kate agrees, '
                 "much to Hortensio and Vincentio's befuddlement, and her real "
                 'transformation begins. Upon arriving in Padua, Vincentio '
                 'finds a man masquerading as him, and the disguises begin to '
                 'become unraveled. After all the impersonators have been '
                 'found out, the play ends with a banquet in honor of all the '
                 'newlyweds: Kate and Petruchio, Bianca and Lucentio, and the '
                 'Widow and Hortensio. As the feast is winding down, the women '
                 'adjourn, and the men begin to wager on who has the most '
                 'obedient wife. They wager 100 crowns, each man sure his wife '
                 'will come when he calls. Lucentio calls for Bianca but she '
                 'refuses to come. Hortensio calls for the Widow, but she '
                 'refuses as well. Petruchio calls for Kate, and much to '
                 "everyone's deep surprise and amazement, she comes directly. "
                 "She then astounds everyone by not only following Petruchio's "
                 'instructions to the letter but also offering a long and '
                 "important speech on a woman's duty to her husband. The play "
                 'ends with the banquet guests stunned at what they have just '
                 'witnessed while the newly tamed Kate and Petruchio leave the '
                 'party together.',

{'author': 'William Shakespeare',
 'book_title': 'The Tempest',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'The Tempest opens in the midst of a storm, as a ship '
                 'containing the king of Naples and his party struggles to '
                 'stay afloat. On land, Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, '
                 'watch the storm envelop the ship. Prospero has created the '
                 'storm with magic, and he explains that his enemies are on '
                 'board the ship. The story Prospero relates is that he is the '
                 'rightful Duke of Milan and that his younger brother, '
                 'Antonio, betrayed him, seizing his title and property. '
                 'Twelve years earlier, Prospero and Miranda were put out to '
                 'sea in little more than a raft. Miraculously, they both '
                 'survived and arrived safely on this island, where Prospero '
                 'learned to control the magic that he now uses to manipulate '
                 'everyone on the island. Upon his arrival, Prospero rescued a '
                 'sprite, Ariel, who had been imprisoned by the witch Sycorax. '
                 'Ariel wishes to be free and his freedom has been promised '
                 'within two days. The last inhabitant of the island is the '
                 'child of Sycorax and the devil: Caliban, whom Prospero has '
                 'enslaved. Caliban is a natural man, uncivilized and wishing '
                 'only to have his island returned to him to that he can live '
                 'alone in peace. Soon the royal party from the ship is cast '
                 "ashore and separated into three groups. The king's son, "
                 'Ferdinand, is brought to Prospero, where he sees Miranda, '
                 'and the two fall instantly in love. Meanwhile, Alonso, the '
                 'king of Naples, and the rest of his party have come ashore '
                 'on another part of the island. Alonso fears that Ferdinand '
                 'is dead and grieves for the loss of his son. Antonio, '
                 "Prospero's younger brother, has also been washed ashore with "
                 "the king's younger brother, Sebastian. Antonio easily "
                 'convinces Sebastian that Sebastian should murder his brother '
                 'and seize the throne for himself. This plot to murder Alonso '
                 "is similar to Antonio's plot against his own brother, "
                 'Prospero, 12 years earlier. Another part of the royal party '
                 '— the court jester and the butler — has also come ashore. '
                 'Trinculo and Stefano each stumble upon Caliban, and each '
                 'immediately sees a way to make money by exhibiting Caliban '
                 'as a monster recovered from this uninhabited island. Stefano '
                 'has come ashore in a wine cask, and soon Caliban, Trinculo, '
                 'and Stefano are drunk. While drinking, Caliban hatches a '
                 'plot to murder Prospero and enrolls his two new '
                 'acquaintances as accomplices. Ariel is listening, however, '
                 'and reports the plot to Prospero. Meanwhile, Prospero has '
                 'kept Ferdinand busy and has forbidden Miranda to speak to '
                 'him, but the two still find time to meet and declare their '
                 'love, which is actually what Prospero has planned. Next, '
                 "Prospero stages a masque to celebrate the young couple's "
                 'betrothal, with goddesses and nymphs entertaining the couple '
                 'with singing and dancing. While Ferdinand and Miranda have '
                 'been celebrating their love, Alonso and the rest of the '
                 "royal party have been searching for the king's son. "
                 'Exhausted from the search and with the king despairing of '
                 'ever seeing his son alive, Prospero has ghosts and an '
                 "imaginary banquet brought before the king's party. A "
                 'god-like voice accuses Antonio, Alonso, and Sebastian of '
                 'their sins, and the banquet vanishes. The men are all '
                 'frightened, and Alonso, Antonio, and Sebastian run away. '
                 'Prospero punishes Caliban, Trinculo, and Stefano with a run '
                 'through a briar patch and swim in a scummy pond. Having '
                 "accomplished what he set out to do, Prospero has the king's "
                 'party brought in. Prospero is clothed as the rightful Duke '
                 'of Milan, and when the spell has been removed, Alonso '
                 "rejects all claims to Prospero's dukedom and apologizes for "
                 'his mistakes. Within moments, Prospero reunites the king '
                 'with his son, Ferdinand. Alonso is especially pleased to '
                 "learn of Miranda's existence and that Ferdinand will marry "
                 'her. Prospero then turns to his brother, Antonio, who offers '
                 'no regrets or apology for his perfidy. Nevertheless, '
                 'Prospero promises not to punish Antonio as a traitor. When '
                 'Caliban is brought in, Caliban tells Prospero that he has '

                 "to Paris on a secret mission for his employer, Tellson's "

                 '17-year-old woman who is stunned to learn that her father, '
                 'Doctor Alexandre Manette , is alive and has recently been '
                 'released after having been secretly imprisoned in Paris for '

                 "Doctor Manette, warning them that the Doctor's years in "
                 'prison have greatly changed him. Thin and pale, Doctor '
                 "Manette sits at a shoemaker's bench intently making shoes. "
                 'He barely responds to questions from Defarge and Mr. Lorry, '

{'author': "Tim O'Brien",
 'book_title': 'The Things They Carried',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Protagonist "Tim O\'Brien" is a middle-aged writer and '
                 'Vietnam War veteran. The primary action of the novel is '
                 '"O\'Brien\'s" remembering the past and working and reworking '
                 'the details of these memories of his service in Vietnam into '
                 'meaning. Through a series of linked semi-autobiographical '
                 'stories, "O\'Brien" illuminates the characters of the men '
                 'with whom he served and draws meaning about the war from '
                 'meditations on their relationships. He describes Lt. Jimmy '
                 'Cross as an inexperienced and ill-equipped leader of Alpha '
                 'Company, both in-country and at a post-war reunion. Years '
                 'after the war, the two spent an afternoon together '
                 'remembering their friends and those who were killed. In the '
                 "introductory vignette, O'Brien describes each of the major "
                 'characters by describing what they carry, from physical '
                 'items such as canteens and grenades and lice to the emotions '
                 'of fear and love that they carry. After the first chapter, '
                 'the narrator is identified as "Tim O\'Brien," a middle-aged '
                 'writer and veteran. "O\'Brien" relates personal stories, '
                 'among them a story that he had never divulged before about '
                 'how he planned to flee to Canada to avoid the draft. '
                 '"O\'Brien," who spent the summer before he had to report to '
                 'the Army working in a meatpacking factory, left work early '
                 'one day and drove toward Canada, stopping at a fishing lodge '
                 'to rest and devise a plan. He is taken in by the lodge '
                 'owner, who helps him confront the issue of evading the draft '
                 'by taking him out on the lake that borders Canada. '
                 'Ultimately, "O\'Brien" yields to what he perceives as '
                 'societal pressures to conform to notions of duty, courage, '
                 'and obligation, and he returns home instead of continuing on '
                 'to Canada. Through the telling of this story, "O\'Brien" '
                 'confesses what he considers a failure of his convictions: He '
                 'was a coward because he went to participate in a war in '
                 "which he did not believe. As a writer, O'Brien constantly "
                 'analyzes and comments upon how stories are told and why they '
                 "are told. For example, he tells the story of Curt Lemon's "
                 'death and proceeds to analyze and explain why it holds an '
                 'element of truth. Ultimately, he surmises, "truth in a story '
                 'is not necessarily due to \'factual\' accuracy." Instead, if '
                 'the story affects the reader or listener in a personal and '
                 'meaningful way, then that emotion is the truth of the story. '
                 "O'Brien tests these ideas by relating the stories that "
                 'others told in Vietnam, like the story of a soldier who '
                 'brought his girlfriend to Vietnam and grows more and more '
                 'terrified as she becomes fascinated by the war and '
                 'ultimately never returns home. The soldiers who hear the '
                 'story doubt its truth, but are drawn into the story '
                 'nonetheless, showing that factual accuracy is less important '
                 'to truth than emotional involvement. The recurring memory of '
                 "the novel that O'Brien recalls as a sort of coda, or "
                 'repeated image, is the death of his friend and fellow '
                 'soldier, Kiowa. Kiowa was a soft-spoken Native American with '
                 'whom "O\'Brien" made a strong connection. The scene of '
                 "Kiowa's death in a battlefield becomes the basis for several "
                 'of the novel\'s vignettes: "Speaking of Courage," "In the '
                 'Field," "Field Trip," and "Notes." In each of these, '
                 "O'Brien recalls snippets of memory and builds an indictment "
                 'against the wastefulness of the war. In "Speaking of '
                 'Courage," the fictional "O\'Brien" presents a story that he '
                 'wrote about a Vietnam comrade named Norman Bowker. '
                 '"O\'Brien" describes Bowker\'s difficulty adjusting to '
                 'civilian life after he returns from Vietnam as he recalls '
                 'his own ease slipping back into the routine of daily life, '
                 'which for him was graduate school. In the end, in "Notes," '
                 '"O\'Brien" describes how Bowker suggested that he '
                 '("O\'Brien") write a story about a veteran with problems '
                 'readjusting and intense feelings of survivor guilt. '
                 '"O\'Brien" realizes that he must not have put the memories '
                 'of Vietnam behind him because he constantly writes about '
                 'them. Finally, "O\'Brien" remembers a girl from his '
                 'childhood who died from cancer, the first dead body he saw '
                 'before being in-country. He describes how as a little boy, '
                 '"Timmy," he could dream her alive and see and talk to her. '
                 'He recognizes the similarity of his ability to animate her '
                 'in his mind and his writing about Vietnam, and realizes that '
                 'he tells these stories to save his own life.',

                 'told, as noted earlier, in the form of a frame. In the first '
                 'few pages, Janie returns to her hometown of Eatonville, '
                 'Florida, after nearly two years absence. Her neighbors are '
                 'curious to know where she has been and what has happened to '
                 'her. They wonder why she is returning in dirty overalls when '
                 'she left in bridal satin. Janie tells her story to her '
                 'friend Pheoby Watson, and after the story is over, the '
                 "novelist returns to Janie's back steps. Thus, the story, "
                 "which actually spans nearly 40 years of Janie's life, is "
                 '"framed" by an evening visit between two friends. The story '
                 'that Janie tells is about love — how Janie sought love in '
                 'four relationships. First, she looked for love from the '
                 'grandmother who raised her. Next, she sought love from Logan '
                 'Killicks, her first husband, a stodgy old potato farmer, who '
                 'Nanny believed offered Janie security. Her third '
                 'relationship involved Joe Starks. Their union lasted nearly '
                 '20 years and brought her economic security and an enviable '
                 "position as the mayor's wife. Janie endured this marriage in "
                 'the shadow of charismatic, ambitious Joe, a man who knew how '
                 'to handle people, money, and power, but who had no '
                 "perception of Janie's simple wish to be respected and loved. "
                 "Janie's final relationship was with migrant worker Tea Cake, "
                 'who gave Janie the love that she had always desired. With '
                 'Tea Cake, Janie was able to experience true love and '
                 'happiness for the first time in her life. As a widow, Janie '
                 "would sell Joe's crossroads store, close up her comfortable "
                 'home, and leave with her new husband to share his life as a '
                 'bean picker in the muck of the Everglades. Tea Cake '

                 "met new people, Tea Cake's fun-loving friends, and "
                 'experienced another community. Her life with Tea Cake was '
                 'far different than her life with Joe. This marriage and '

                 'her cross a bridge with a strange man, he stops them and '
                 'discovers that the man is an English nobleman, the duke of '
                 "Buckingham, the queen's secret lover; being an Englishman, "
                 'the man is also an enemy of France. That night, the queen '
                 'gives the duke an elegant gift of twelve diamond tags in a '
                 'rosewood box. When the cardinal, through his extended and '
                 "vast network of spies (one of whom is among the queen's "
                 'ladies-in-waiting) discovers that the queen has given '
                 'Buckingham the diamond tags, he asks the king to give a '
                 "fabulous ball and demand that the queen wear the king's gift "
                 'to her: the twelve diamond tags. The queen is terrified when '
                 'she learns about the ball and hears her husband order her to '
                 'wear the diamond tags. She knows very well that they are in '
                 'London, in the possession of the duke of Buckingham. '
                 'Meanwhile, the cardinal sends one of his spies — the elegant '
                 'and beautiful Milady — to London; he instructs her to dance '
                 'with the duke, snip off at least two of the diamond tags, '
                 'and return them to the cardinal so that he can use them in a '
                 'blackmail scheme. Ready to help the queen regain the diamond '
                 'tags, whatever the cost, Constance Bonacieux pleads with '
                 "d'Artagnan to undertake the dangerous trip to London in "
                 'order to retrieve the diamond tags from the duke before the '
                 "ball and thereby save the queen's reputation. D'Artagnan "
                 "readily accepts Constance's request, and accompanied by the "
                 'three musketeers, he begins the hazardous trip to London. On '
                 "the way, they are continually ambushed by the cardinal's "
                 'spies, and one by one, the musketeers are foiled from '
                 "accompanying d'Artagnan to London. When d'Artagnan reaches "
                 'London, he reports the situation to Buckingham, who '
                 'discovers in horror that two of the tags are missing. '
                 'Immediately, he calls in his personal jeweler and instructs '
                 'him to work furiously in order to make exact copies. He '
                 "gives the copies to d'Artagnan, along with the remaining ten "
                 'tags, and a superb, prearranged series of horses that will '
                 "take d'Artagnan from London to Paris in twelve hours. Thus, "
                 'the queen is able to appear in what seems to be all twelve '
                 'of the diamond tags — to the utter astonishment of the '
                 "cardinal. For d'Artagnan's heroic efforts, the queen "
                 'secretly presents him with a large, magnificent diamond '
                 'ring. After agreeing to a rendezvous with Constance (which '
                 'never takes place because she is again abducted by the '
                 "cardinal's men), d'Artagnan is told that it is dangerous to "
                 'remain in Paris: the cardinal knows everything that happens '
                 'in Paris; it will not be long, before he learns about '
                 "d'Artagnan's role in the diamond tag escapade. D'Artagnan "
                 'therefore decides that this would be a good time to discover '
                 'what happened to his musketeer friends. He returns to each '
                 'of the places where he left them, and finding them all safe, '
                 'they return to Paris — only to discover that they must buy '
                 "equipment for the king's next military maneuver: the siege "
                 'of La Rochelle. Each of the musketeers must find some way of '
                 'getting money — something they are always short of. While '
                 "pondering how to get some cash, d'Artagnan sees Milady by "
                 'accident and is overwhelmed by her beauty; he follows her '
                 'and tries to protect her from a bothersome man who turns out '
                 'to be her brother-in-law. The brother-in-law challenges '
                 "d'Artagnan to a duel and they fight. D'Artagnan overpowers "
                 'him, but spares his life. In appreciation for his life, the '
                 "brother-in-law — Lord de Winter — introduces d'Artagnan to "
                 "Milady, Lady de Winter. Meanwhile, Milady's maid sees "
                 "d'Artagnan and falls in love with him, and later she tells "
                 'him that Milady is madly in love with Count de Wardes, the '
                 "man whom d'Artagnan wounded just before sailing to London. "
                 "She also gives d'Artagnan a love note which Milady has "
                 "written to de Wardes. D'Artagnan is so furious that he "
                 "forges de Wardes' signature on a return letter to Milady, "
                 'arranging a dark, nighttime rendezvous with Milady. While '
                 "she thinks that she's making love to de Wardes, d'Artagnan "
                 'will be making passionate love to her. The plan works, and '
                 "afterward Milady is so satisfied that she gives d'Artagnan "
                 'an elegant sapphire ring surrounded with diamonds, promising '
                 'to have "that stupid d\'Artagnan" killed for having wounded '
                 "de Wardes, the man she thinks she's been making love to in "
                 "the darkness. Later, d'Artagnan is furious, and, in order to "
                 'get revenge against her, he answers another love note of '
                 "hers to de Wardes, signing de Wardes' name under a flippant "
                 'reminder that Milady has to "wait her turn." Milady is so '
                 "incensed that she asks d'Artagnan to kill de Wardes, and as "
                 "prepayment she goes to bed with him. d'Artagnan is so "
                 "enamored by Milady's loveliness that he impulsively reveals "
                 'that this is not the first time that he has made love to '
                 'her: earlier, when she thought that she was making love in '
                 "the dark to de Wardes — she wasn't. D'Artagnan was in bed "
                 "with her. Milady rears up and tries to kill d'Artagnan and "
                 "as they scuffle, her nightgown is torn and d'Artagnan sees "
                 'the mark of a convict branded on one of her shoulders. The '
                 'discovery of this secret is so terrible that Milady vows '
                 "that d'Artagnan will die. By a stroke of good fortune, "
                 "however, and some help from Kitty, d'Artagnan escapes. "
                 'Relating the adventure to Athos later, the two men discover '
                 "that Milady is Athos's wife, a woman whom he thought he "
                 'hanged after he discovered that she was a branded criminal. '
                 'Athos and d\'Artagnan decide to sell Milady\'s "tainted" '
                 "ring — which originally belonged to Athos's family — and now "
                 'they are both able to buy their equipment for the siege of '
                 'La Rochelle. Meantime, Porthos has obtained his equipment '
                 'from his aging, miserly mistress, and Aramis has obtained '
                 'his equipment from his beloved friend, Madame de Chevreuse. '
                 "Before d'Artagnan and the musketeers leave in their separate "
                 'regiments for the siege, the king becomes ill, and '
                 "d'Artagnan's group moves out first, leaving the musketeers "
                 "behind for the time being to await the king. d'Artagnan is "
                 'lonesome for his friends and, one day, he wanders off alone '
                 '— not a wise decision, because he is fired at by two of '
                 "Milady's hired assassions. Later, during a dangerous mission "
                 "that d'Artagnan is leading, the same two assassins again try "
                 'to kill him. When this attempt fails, Milady decides to have '
                 "some poisoned wine delivered to d'Artagnan -compliments of "
                 '"the three musketeers." D\'Artagnan does not realize that '
                 'the wine is poisoned, and he is so busy talking that he '
                 'fails to drink the wine immediately. Instead, another '
                 'soldier drinks the wine — and falls dead. Meanwhile, the '
                 'three musketeers are enjoying their leisure time, drinking '
                 'and joking, and, by chance, they meet the cardinal, who is '
                 'going to a meeting with Milady, who is staying at the inn '
                 'which the musketeers just left. The musketeers accompany the '
                 'cardinal and listen through a broken stovepipe to the '
                 'conversation. Milady, they learn, is going to London to make '
                 'sure that the duke of Buckingham is killed; in return, the '
                 "cardinal will take revenge against d'Artagnan. The "
                 "musketeers immediately decide on a plan to warn d'Artagnan "
                 'and Buckingham. Thus, when Milady arrives in England, she is '
                 'taken prisoner by her brother-in-law, de Winter. However, '
                 'she cleverly corrupts her jailer, convinces him (a religious '
                 'puritan fanatic) that Buckingham deserves to be put to '
                 'death, and he obeys her. She then escapes to France, where '
                 'she is determined to complete her revenge against '
                 "d'Artagnan. She goes to the convent where the queen has "
                 "placed Constance Bonacieux, d'Artagnan's beloved, for "
                 "protection, and there Milady wins the young girl's "
                 "confidence. Precisely when d'Artagnan and the musketeers "
                 'arrive to rescue Constance, Milady poisons her and escapes. '
                 "D'Artagnan and the musketeers track her down, accuse her of "
                 'her many crimes — and execute her. When the entire story is '
                 'revealed later to the cardinal, he is horrified at the '
                 "extent of Milady's evil web of death, and he is extremely "
                 "impressed with d'Artagnan's laudable actions. Consequently, "
                 "he writes out a commission for d'Artagnan to become a "
                 "lieutenant in the King's Musketeers. After offering the "
                 'commission to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis and being refused '
                 "by all three, d'Artagnan accepts the prestigious commission "
                 'at the early age of twenty-one.',

 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Things Fall Apart is about the tragic fall of the '
                 'protagonist, Okonkwo, and the Igbo culture. Okonkwo is a '
                 'respected and influential leader within the Igbo community '
                 'of Umuofia in eastern Nigeria. He first earns personal fame '
                 'and distinction, and brings honor to his village, when he '
                 'defeats Amalinze the Cat in a wrestling contest. Okonkwo '
                 'determines to gain titles for himself and become a powerful '
                 "and wealthy man in spite of his father's weaknesses. "
                 "Okonkwo's father, Unoka, was a lazy and wasteful man. He "
                 'often borrowed money and then squandered it on palm-wine and '
                 'merrymaking with friends. Consequently, his wife and '
                 'children often went hungry. Within the community, Unoka was '
                 'considered a failure and a laughingstock. He was referred to '
                 'as agbala , one who resembles the weakness of a woman and '
                 'has no property. Unoka died a shameful death and left '
                 "numerous debts. Okonkwo despises and resents his father's "
                 'gentle and idle ways. He resolves to overcome the shame that '
                 "he feels as a result of his father's weaknesses by being "
                 'what he considers to be "manly"; therefore, he dominates his '
                 'wives and children by being insensitive and controlling. '
                 'Because Okonkwo is a leader of his community, he is asked to '
                 'care for a young boy named Ikemefuna, who is given to the '
                 'village as a peace offering by neighboring Mbaino to avoid '
                 "war with Umuofia. Ikemefuna befriends Okonkwo's son, Nwoye, "
                 'and Okonkwo becomes inwardly fond of the boy. Over the '
                 'years, Okonkwo becomes an extremely volatile man; he is apt '
                 'to explode at the slightest provocation. He violates the '
                 'Week of Peace when he beats his youngest wife, Ojiugo, '
                 "because she went to braid her hair at a friend's house and "
                 'forgot to prepare the afternoon meal and feed her children. '
                 'Later, he severely beats and shoots a gun at his second '
                 'wife, Ekwefi, because she took leaves from his banana plant '
                 'to wrap food for the Feast of the New Yam. After the coming '
                 'of the locusts, Ogbuefi Ezeuder, the oldest man in the '
                 'village, relays to Okonkwo a message from the Oracle. The '
                 'Oracle says that Ikemefuna must be killed as part of the '
                 'retribution for the Umuofian woman killed three years '
                 'earlier in Mbaino. He tells Okonkwo not to partake in the '
                 "murder, but Okonkwo doesn't listen. He feels that not "
                 'participating would be a sign of weakness. Consequently, '
                 'Okonkwo kills Ikemefuna with his machete. Nwoye realizes '
                 'that his father has murdered Ikemefuna and begins to '
                 'distance himself from his father and the clansmen. Okonkwo '
                 'becomes depressed after killing Ikemefuna, so he visits his '
                 'best friend, Obierika, who disapproves of his role in '
                 "Ikemefuna's killing. Obierika says that Okonkwo's act will "
                 'upset the Earth and the earth goddess will seek revenge. '
                 "After discussing Ikemefuna's death with Obierika, Okonkwo is "
                 'finally able to sleep restfully, but he is awakened by his '
                 'wife Ekwefi. Their daughter Ezinma, whom Okonkwo is fond of, '
                 'is dying. Okonkwo gathers grasses, barks, and leaves to '
                 'prepare medicine for Ezinma. A public trial is held on the '
                 'village commons. Nine clan leaders, including Okonkwo, '
                 'represent the spirits of their ancestors. The nine clan '
                 'leaders, or egwugwu , also represent the nine villages of '
                 'Umuofia. Okonkwo does not sit among the other eight leaders, '
                 'or elders, while they listen to a dispute between an '
                 'estranged husband and wife. The wife, Mgbafo, had been '
                 'severely beaten by her husband. Her brother took her back to '
                 "their family's village, but her husband wanted her back "
                 'home. The egwugwu tell the husband to take wine to his '
                 'in-laws and beg his wife to come home. One elder wonders why '
                 'such a trivial dispute would come before the egwugwu. In her '
                 "role as priestess, Chielo tells Ekwefi (Okonkwo's second "
                 'wife) that Agbala (the Oracle of the Hills and Caves) needs '
                 'to see Ezinma. Although Okonkwo and Ekwefi protest, Chielo '
                 'takes a terrified Ezinma on her back and forbids anyone to '
                 'follow. Chielo carries Ezinma to all nine villages and then '
                 "enters the Oracle's cave. Ekwefi follows secretly, in spite "
                 "of Chielo's admonitions, and waits at the entrance of the "
                 'Oracle. Okonkwo surprises Ekwefi by arriving at the cave, '
                 'and he also waits with her. The next morning, Chielo takes '
                 "Ezinma to Ekwefi's hut and puts her to bed. When Ogbuefi "
                 'Ezeudu dies, Okonkwo worries because the last time that '
                 'Ezeudu visited him was when he warned Okonkwo against '
                 'participating in the killing of Ikemefuna. Ezeudu was an '
                 'important leader in the village and achieved three titles of '
                 "the clan's four, a rare accomplishment. During the large "
                 "funeral, Okonkwo's gun goes off, and Ezeudu's "
                 'sixteen-year-old son is killed accidentally. Because the '
                 'accidental killing of a clansman is a crime against the '
                 'earth goddess, Okonkwo and his family must be exiled from '
                 "Umuofia for seven years. The family moves to Okonkwo's "
                 "mother's native village, Mbanta. After they depart Umuofia, "
                 "a group of village men destroy Okonkwo's compound and kill "
                 "his animals to cleanse the village of Okonkwo's sin. "
                 "Obierika stores Okonkwo's yams in his barn and wonders about "
                 'the old traditions of the Igbo culture. Okonkwo is welcomed '
                 'to Mbanta by his maternal uncle, Uchendu, a village elder. '
                 'He gives Okonkwo a plot of land on which to farm and build a '
                 'compound for his family. But Okonkwo is depressed, and he '
                 'blames his chi (or personal spirit) for his failure to '
                 "achieve lasting greatness. During Okonkwo's second year in "
                 'exile, he receives a visit from his best friend, Obierika, '
                 'who recounts sad news about the village of Abame: After a '
                 'white man rode into the village on a bicycle, the elders of '
                 'Abame consulted their Oracle, which told them that the white '
                 'man would destroy their clan and other clans. Consequently, '
                 'the villagers killed the white man. But weeks later, a large '
                 'group of men slaughtered the villagers in retribution. The '
                 'village of Abame is now deserted. Okonkwo and Uchendu agree '
                 'that the villagers were foolish to kill a man whom they knew '
                 'nothing about. Later, Obierika gives Okonkwo money that he '
                 "received from selling Okonkwo's yams and seed-yams, and he "
                 'promises to do so until Okonkwo returns to Umuofia. Six '
                 'missionaries, including one white man, arrive in Mbanta. The '
                 'white man speaks to the people about Christianity. Okonkwo '
                 'believes that the man speaks nonsense, but his son, Nwoye, '
                 'is captivated and becomes a convert of Christianity. The '
                 'Christian missionaries build a church on land given to them '
                 'by the village leaders. However, the land is a part of the '
                 'Evil Forest, and according to tradition, the villagers '
                 'believe that the missionaries will die because they built '
                 'their church on cursed land. But when nothing happens to the '
                 'missionaries, the people of Mbanta conclude that the '
                 'missionaries possess extraordinary power and magic. The '
                 'first recruits of the missionaries are efulefu , the weak '
                 'and worthless men of the village. Other villagers, including '
                 'a woman, soon convert to Christianity. The missionaries then '
                 "go to Umuofia and start a school. Nwoye leaves his father's "
                 'hut and moves to Umuofia so he can attend the school. '
                 "Okonkwo's exile is over, so his family arranges to return to "
                 'Umuofia. Before leaving Mbanta, they prepare a huge feast '
                 "for Okonkwo's mother's kinsmen in appreciation of their "
                 "gratitude during Okonkwo's seven years of exile. When "
                 'Okonkwo returns to Umuofia, he discovers that the village '
                 'has changed during his absence. Many men have renounced '
                 'their titles and have converted to Christianity. The white '
                 'men have built a prison; they have established a government '
                 'court of law, where people are tried for breaking the white '
                 "man's laws; and they also employ natives of Umuofia. Okonkwo "
                 'wonders why the Umuofians have not incited violence to rid '
                 "the village of the white man's church and oppressive "
                 'government. Some members of the Igbo clan like the changes '
                 'in Umuofia. Mr. Brown, the white missionary, respects the '
                 'Igbo traditions. He makes an effort to learn about the Igbo '
                 'culture and becomes friendly with some of the clan leaders. '
                 'He also encourages Igbo people of all ages to get an '
                 'education. Mr. Brown tells Okonkwo that Nwoye, who has taken '
                 'the name Isaac, is attending a teaching college. '
                 'Nevertheless, Okonkwo is unhappy about the changes in '
                 'Umuofia. After Mr. Brown becomes ill and is forced to return '
                 'to his homeland, Reverend James Smith becomes the new head '
                 'of the Christian church. But Reverend Smith is nothing like '
                 'Mr. Brown; he is intolerant of clan customs and is very '
                 'strict. Violence arises after Enoch, an overzealous convert '
                 'to Christianity, unmasks an egwugwu. In retaliation, the '
                 "egwugwu burn Enoch's compound and then destroy the Christian "
                 'church because the missionaries have caused the Igbo people '
                 'many problems. When the District Commissioner returns to '
                 'Umuofia, he learns about the destruction of the church and '
                 'asks six leaders of the village, including Okonkwo, to meet '
                 'with him. The men are jailed until they pay a fine of two '
                 'hundred and fifty bags of cowries. The people of Umuofia '
                 'collect the money and pay the fine, and the men are set '
                 'free. The next day at a meeting for clansmen, five court '
                 'messengers who intend to stop the gathering approach the '
                 'group. Suddenly, Okonkwo jumps forward and beheads the man '
                 'in charge of the messengers with his machete. When none of '
                 'the other clansmen attempt to stop the messengers who '
                 'escape, Okonkwo realizes that they will never go to war and '
                 'that Umuofia will surrender. Everything has fallen apart for '
                 'Okonkwo; he commits suicide by hanging himself.',

 'summary_text': 'A widower, Atticus raises his children by himself, with the '
                 'help of kindly neighbors and a black housekeeper named '
                 'Calpurnia. Scout and Jem almost instinctively understand the '
                 'complexities and machinations of their neighborhood and '
                 'town. The only neighbor who puzzles them is the mysterious '
                 'Arthur Radley, nicknamed Boo, who never comes outside. When '
                 "Dill, another neighbor's nephew, starts spending summers in "
                 'Maycomb, the three children begin an obsessive — and '
                 'sometimes perilous — quest to lure Boo outside. Scout is a '
                 'tomboy who prefers the company of boys and generally solves '
                 'her differences with her fists. She tries to make sense of a '
                 'world that demands that she act like a lady, a brother who '
                 'criticizes her for acting like a girl, and a father who '
                 'accepts her just as she is. Scout hates school, gaining her '
                 'most valuable education on her own street and from her '
                 'father. Not quite midway through the story, Scout and Jem '
                 'discover that their father is going to represent a black man '
                 'named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping and beating a '
                 'white woman. Suddenly, Scout and Jem have to tolerate a '
                 "barrage of racial slurs and insults because of Atticus' role "
                 'in the trial. During this time, Scout has a very difficult '
                 'time restraining from physically fighting with other '
                 'children, a tendency that gets her in trouble with her Aunt '
                 'Alexandra and Uncle Jack. Even Jem, the older and more '
                 'levelheaded of the two, loses his temper a time or two. '
                 "After responding to a neighbor's (Mrs. Dubose) verbal attack "
                 'by destroying her plants, Jem is sentenced to read to her '
                 'every day after school for one month. Ultimately, Scout and '
                 'Jem learn a powerful lesson about bravery from this woman. '
                 'As the trial draws nearer, Aunt Alexandra comes to live with '
                 'them under the guise of providing a feminine influence for '
                 "Scout. During the novel's last summer, Tom is tried and "
                 'convicted even though Atticus proves that Tom could not have '
                 'possibly committed the crime of which he is accused. In the '
                 "process of presenting Tom's case, Atticus inadvertently "
                 'insults and offends Bob Ewell, a nasty, lazy drunkard whose '
                 "daughter is Tom's accuser. In spite of Tom's conviction, "
                 'Ewell vows revenge on Atticus and the judge for besmirching '
                 'his already tarnished name. All three children are '
                 "bewildered by the jury's decision to convict; Atticus tries "
                 "to explain why the jury's decision was in many ways a "
                 'foregone conclusion. Shortly after the trial, Scout attends '
                 "one of her aunt's Missionary Society meetings. Atticus "
                 'interrupts the meeting to report that Tom Robinson had been '
                 'killed in an escape attempt. Scout learns valuable lessons '
                 'about achieving the ideal of womanhood and carrying on in '
                 'the face of adversity that day. Things slowly return to '
                 'normal in Maycomb, and Scout and Jem realize that Boo Radley '
                 'is no longer an all-consuming curiosity. The story appears '
                 'to be winding down, but then Bob Ewell starts making good on '
                 'his threats of revenge. Scout is in the Halloween pageant at '
                 'school, playing the part of a ham. With Atticus and Aunt '
                 'Alexandra both too tired to attend, Jem agrees to take Scout '
                 'to the school. After embarrassing herself on-stage, Scout '
                 'elects to leave her ham costume on for the walk home with '
                 'Jem. On the way home, the children hear odd noises, but '
                 'convince themselves that the noises are coming from another '
                 'friend who scared them on their way to school that evening. '
                 "Suddenly, a scuffle occurs. Scout really can't see outside "
                 'of her costume, but she hears Jem being pushed away, and she '
                 "feels powerful arms squeezing her costume's chicken wire "
                 'against her skin. During this attack, Jem badly breaks his '
                 'arm. Scout gets just enough of a glimpse out of her costume '
                 'to see a stranger carrying Jem back to their house. The '
                 'sheriff arrives at the Finch house to announce that Bob '
                 'Ewell has been found dead under the tree where the children '
                 'were attacked, having fallen on his own knife. By this time, '
                 'Scout realizes that the stranger is none other than Boo '
                 'Radley, and that Boo is actually responsible for killing '
                 "Ewell, thus saving her and Jem's lives. In spite of Atticus' "
                 'insistence to the contrary, the sheriff refuses to press '
                 'charges against Boo. Scout agrees with this decision and '
                 'explains her understanding to her father. Boo sees Jem one '
                 'more time and then asks Scout to take him home, but rather '
                 'than escort him home as though he were a child, she has Boo '
                 'escort her to his house as a gentleman would. With Boo '
                 "safely home, Scout returns to Jem's room where Atticus is "
                 "waiting. He reads her to sleep and then waits by Jem's "
                 'bedside for his son to wake up.',

 'summary_text': 'An old sailor, calling himself "the captain" but really '
                 'called Billy Bones, comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn '
                 'on the English coast during the mid 1700s, paying the '
                 "innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, a few pennies to keep a "
                 'lookout for "seafaring men." One of these shows up, '
                 'frightening Billy (who drinks far too much rum) into a '
                 'stroke, and Billy tells Jim that his former shipmates covet '
                 'the contents of his sea chest. After a visit from another '
                 'man, Billy has another stroke and dies; Jim and his mother '
                 '(his father has died only a few days before) unlock the sea '
                 'chest, finding some money, a journal, and a map. The local '
                 'physician, Dr. Livesey, deduces that the map is of an island '
                 'where the pirate Flint buried a vast treasure. The district '
                 'squire, Trelawney, proposes buying a ship and going after '
                 "the treasure, taking Livesey as ship's doctor and Jim as "
                 'cabin boy. Several weeks later, Trelawney sends for Jim and '
                 'Livesey and introduces them to Long John Silver, a Bristol '
                 "tavern-keeper whom he has hired as ship's cook. They also "
                 'meet Captain Smollett, who tells them that he does not like '
                 'the crew or the voyage, which it seems everyone in Bristol '
                 'knows is a search for treasure. After taking a few '
                 'precautions, however, they set sail for the distant island. '
                 'During the voyage the first mate, a drunkard, disappears '
                 'overboard. And just before the island is sighted, Jim '
                 'overhears Silver talking with two other crewmen and realizes '
                 'that he and most of the others are pirates and have planned '
                 'a mutiny. Jim tells the captain, Trelawney, and Livesey, and '
                 'they calculate that they will be seven to nineteen against '
                 'the mutineers and must pretend not to suspect anything until '
                 'the treasure is found, when they can surprise their '
                 'adversaries. But after the ship is anchored, Silver and some '
                 'of the others go ashore, and two men who refuse to join the '
                 'mutiny are killed — one with so loud a scream that everyone '
                 'realizes there can be no more pretense. Jim has impulsively '
                 'joined the shore party, and now in running away from them he '
                 'encounters a half-crazy Englishman, Ben Gunn, who tells him '
                 'he was marooned here and can help against the mutineers in '
                 'return for passage home and part of the treasure. Meanwhile '
                 "Smollett, Trelawney, and Livesey, along with Trelawney's "
                 'three servants and one of the other hands, Abraham Gray, '
                 'abandon the ship and come ashore to occupy a stockade. The '
                 'men still on the ship, led by the coxswain Israel Hands, run '
                 "up the pirate flag. One of Trelawney's servants and one of "
                 'the pirates are killed in the fight to reach the stockade, '
                 "and the ship's gun keeps up a barrage upon them, to no "
                 'effect, until dark, when Jim finds the stockade and joins '
                 'them. The next morning Silver appears under a flag of truce, '
                 'offering terms that Captain Smollett refuses, and revealing '
                 'that another pirate has been killed in the night (by Ben '
                 "Gunn, Jim realizes, although Silver does not). At Smollett's "
                 'refusal to surrender the map, Silver threatens an attack, '
                 'and, within a short while, the attack on the stockade is '
                 'launched. After a battle, the surviving mutineers retreat, '
                 "having lost six men, but two more of the captain's group "
                 'have been killed and Smollett himself is badly wounded. When '
                 'Livesey leaves in search of Ben Gunn, Jim runs away without '
                 "permission and finds Gunn's homemade boat. After dark, he "
                 'goes out and cuts the ship adrift. The two pirates on board, '
                 "Hands and O'Brien, interrupt their drunken quarrel to run on "
                 "deck, but the ship — with Jim's boat in her wake — is swept "
                 'out to sea on the ebb tide. Exhausted, Jim falls asleep in '
                 'the boat and wakens the next morning, bobbing along on the '
                 'west coast of the island, carried by a northerly current. '
                 'Eventually, he encounters the ship, which seems deserted, '
                 "but getting on board, he finds O'Brien dead and Hands badly "
                 'wounded. He and Hands agree that they will beach the ship at '
                 'an inlet on the northern coast of the island. But as the '
                 'ship is finally beached, Hands attempts to kill Jim, and Jim '
                 'shoots and kills him. Then, after securing the ship as well '
                 'as he can, he goes back ashore and heads for the stockade. '
                 'Once there, in utter darkness, he enters the blockhouse — to '
                 'be greeted by Silver and the remaining five mutineers, who '
                 'have somehow taken over the stockade in his absence. Silver '
                 'and the others argue about whether to kill Jim, and Silver '
                 'talks them down. He tells Jim that, when everyone found the '
                 "ship was gone, the captain's party agreed to a treaty "
                 'whereby they gave up the stockade and the map. In the '
                 'morning Dr. Livesey arrives to treat the wounded and sick '
                 'pirates, and tells Silver to look out for trouble when they '
                 'find the site of the treasure. After he leaves, Silver and '
                 'the others set out with the map, taking Jim along. '
                 'Eventually they find the treasure cache — empty. Two of the '
                 'pirates charge at Silver and Jim, but are shot down by '
                 'Livesey, Gray, and Ben Gunn, from ambush. The other three '
                 'run away, and Livesey explains that Gunn has long ago found '
                 'the treasure and taken it to his cave. In the next few days '
                 'they load the treasure onto the ship, abandon the three '
                 'remaining mutineers (with supplies and ammunition) and sail '
                 'away. At their first port, where they will sign on more '
                 'crew, Silver steals a bag of money and escapes. The rest '
                 'sail back to Bristol and divide up the treasure. Jim says '
                 'there is more left on the island, but he for one will not '
                 'undertake another voyage to recover it.',

 'summary_text': 'Various critics divide Twelfth Night into various types of '
                 'plots and/or subplots. Regardless of the exact number of '
                 'plots and subplots, however, the main thing is that they are '
                 'all woven together with immense skill to ultimately compose '
                 'a single pattern or tapestry. There is, first, the group '
                 'centering around the ducal nobility of Illyria: this group '
                 'consists of Duke Orsino and his attendants, who open the '
                 'play, and the Countess Olivia, who is the main topic of '
                 'discussion of the opening scene. Then there is the group of '
                 'shipwrecked personages centering on Viola and Sebastian, the '
                 "twins, and their friends, Viola's sea captain who fades from "
                 'the action, and, more important, Antonio, who plays a '
                 'significant role later in the comedy. Both Viola and '
                 'Sebastian are, of course, later absorbed into the nobility '
                 'of Illyria. Then there is the merry group of pranksters, '
                 'gullers, and tricksters, led by Sir Toby Belch and Maria; '
                 'this group also includes Sir Andrew Aguecheek (who is '
                 'included because his income supports the other members of '
                 'this group), Fabian, and Feste, the Clown. Through Feste, '
                 'all of the groups are connected by his free movement from '
                 'one group to another as he is equally at home singing for '
                 'Duke Orsino, or proving Lady Olivia to be a fool for so '
                 'excessively mourning for her brother, or in planning a trick '
                 'with Sir Toby. Then outside of all of these groups stands '
                 "Malvolio, Lady Olivia's puritanical steward. His colossal "
                 'vanity and egotism get between him and everything that he '
                 'sees and does. Thus, he has already gotten on the wrong side '
                 'of Maria, Feste, and Sir Toby, and the plot involving their '
                 'determination to take their revenge upon him provides the '
                 'best humor of the play. Malvolio is socially and sexually '
                 'ambitious; Maria realizes this and writes a letter '
                 'purporting to come from the Countess Olivia, making Malvolio '
                 'believe that his lady is in love with him and wishes to '
                 'marry him; the letter also asks him to be firm and obstinate '
                 'with her uncle, Sir Toby, to be arrogant to the other '
                 'servants, and to dress in yellow stockings and go '
                 'cross-gartered, and to smile all the time when he is near '
                 'her. Malvolio finds the letter on the garden path and falls '
                 'for the trick as he is watched gleefully by the group led by '
                 'Maria and Sir Toby. Viola disguises herself as a boy in '
                 'order to protect herself and to obtain employment by Duke '
                 'Orsino and quickly finds her way (as Cesario, the youth) '
                 'into his favor; she is then sent to woo the Countess Olivia, '
                 "much against Viola's will, for she has fallen in love with "
                 'Count Orsino herself. Countess Olivia, who cannot love Duke '
                 'Orsino, falls immediately in love with the messenger, '
                 'Cesario, thus creating an amusing triangle which produces '
                 "several complications. The arrival of Viola's twin brother, "
                 'Sebastian (previously presumed drowned), sorts everything '
                 'out matrimonially. Sebastian marries Olivia, Orsino marries '
                 'Viola, and Sir Toby marries Maria for having played such an '
                 "excellent trick on Malvolio. This is one of Shakespeare's "
                 'most popular, lightest, and most musical of all his '
                 'comedies, and its staging continues to delight audiences all '
                 'over the world.',

 'book_title': 'Tristram Shandy',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': "Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy is narrated by the title "
                 'character in a series of digressions and interruptions that '
                 'purportedly show the "life and opinions" — part of the '
                 'novel\'s full title — of Tristram. Composed of nine "Books" '
                 'originally published between 1759-1767, the novel has more '
                 'to do with Shandy family members and their foibles and '
                 'history than it seemingly does with Tristram himself. '
                 "However, it is through Tristram's relating the actions, "
                 'beliefs, and opinions of his family members — primarily his '
                 'father, Walter Shandy, and his paternal Uncle Toby — that '
                 "the reader gets a clearer picture of Tristram's character. "
                 "Books 1-6 revolve around Tristram's conception (the novel "
                 'begins the evening of his conception); his birth (with a '
                 'smashed nose that supposedly bodes ill warnings for his '
                 'future); his mistaken naming (according to his father prior '
                 'to Tristram\'s birth, "Tristram" is the worst possible name '
                 'for a child); and his circumcision (while urinating out a '
                 'window, the window falls). However, these events actually '
                 "take up very little of these first six books' action. "
                 'Instead, the narration is continuously interrupted by '
                 'stories, diatribes, and opinions concerning family history, '
                 "Walter Shandy's hypotheses and theories, and Uncle Toby's "
                 'penchant for military fortifications to the point that '
                 "readers today might easily become frustrated with Tristram's "
                 'inability to get to the point (which, ironically, is the '
                 'point — Tristram is relating his "life and opinions," and '
                 'they come to him in a disjointed fashion). Book 7 concerns '
                 'an older Tristram traveling in France for health reasons. '
                 'The book seems isolated from the story that precedes and '
                 "follows it. Books 8 and 9 revolve around Uncle Toby's affair "
                 "with the Widow Wadman, who is concerned about Uncle Toby's "
                 'supposed groin injury and seeks to find out just how injured '
                 'his groin is. Again, as in earlier books in the novel, '
                 'numerous digressions and interruptions are spread throughout '
                 'these two books, and Tristram through his mother, Mrs. '
                 'Shandy, finally asks, "What is all this story about?"',

{'author': 'James Joyce',
 'book_title': 'Ulysses',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Ulysses begins at about 8:00 a.m. on Thursday, June 16, '
                 '1904, in Dublin, Ireland, when one of its major '
                 'participants, young Stephen Dedalus, awakens and interacts '
                 'with his two housemates, the egotistical medical student, '
                 'Buck Mulligan, and the overly reserved English student, '
                 'Haines. The narrative ends some twenty-four hours later, '
                 'when Stephen, having politely refused lodgings at the home '
                 'of two other principal characters, Leopold and Molly Bloom, '
                 'discovers he is no longer welcome to stay with Mulligan and '
                 'Haines. During the sixteen hours of narrative time, the '
                 'characters move through their day in Dublin, interacting '
                 'with a stunning variety of individuals, most of whom are '
                 'fictional but some of whom represent actual people. Ulysses '
                 'stands as an inventive, multiple-point-of-view (there are '
                 'eighteen) vision of daily events, personal attitudes, '
                 'cultural and political sentiments, and observations of the '
                 'human condition. It is written in a number of differing '
                 'literary styles, ranging from internal monologue to '
                 'first-person speculation to question-and-answer from a '
                 'catechism to newspaper headlines. The work has eighteen '
                 "chapters. When taken in context with James Joyce's grander "
                 "design for it (a playful comparison to Homer's epic poem, "
                 'The Odyssey ), Ulysses gains complexity, irony, and dramatic '
                 'intensity. Not only does Stephen Dedalus become all the more '
                 'vivid because of his comparison to Telemachus, the son of '
                 'Ulysses, King of Ithaca, in the Homeric epic. The other main '
                 'character, Leopold Bloom, may be seen as the wandering '
                 'Ulysses. In The Odyssey, Ulysses is seen returning to his '
                 'wife, that symbol of womanly and cultural virtue, Penelope; '
                 'in the novel, Joyce uses irony to represent Penelope as '
                 'Molly Bloom, who that very afternoon had an adulterous '
                 'encounter with her lover, Blazes Boylan. Incidents in the '
                 'novel have counterparts in the Homeric epic, sometimes to a '
                 'broadly farcical effect, other times to a more punning or '
                 "humorous effect, and still others to fit Joyce's own sense "
                 'of social or political irony. For instance, Chapter One in '
                 'Ulysses, r eferred to as "Telemachus" by Joyce, establishes '
                 'the link to come between Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. '
                 'It shows Stephen getting up and leaving for work. Those '
                 'familiar with The Odyssey will be amused by the parallels '
                 'between Mulligan and Haines and the suitors of Penelope. In '
                 'The Odyssey, Telemachus, son of Ulysses, King of Ithaca, is '
                 'persuaded to venture out in search of his long-absent '
                 'father. Chapters Two and Three of The Odyssey show '
                 'Telemachus meeting Nestor, an old windbag of a counselor to '
                 'his father. In the novel, Stephen is shown in conversation '
                 'with Mr. Deasey, headmaster of the school where he teaches. '
                 'In addition to being anti-Semitic, anti-feminist, and wildly '
                 'pro-British, Mr. Deasey is a repository of misinformation. '
                 'The first three episodes of Ulysses focus on Stephen '
                 'Dedalus, a problematically autobiographical character first '
                 "introduced in Joyce's published work through A Portrait of "
                 'the Artist as a Young Man. In Chapter One, Stephen, '
                 'Mulligan, and Haines prepare for the day. In Chapter Two, '
                 "Stephen is teaching in a boys' school. While the class "
                 "recites Milton's Lycidas, he broods about his life so far, "
                 'his ambitions to be a great writer, and his doubts. In '
                 'Chapter Three, Stephen walks along the seafront and reflects '
                 'upon the things he sees — midwives, cockle-pickers, '
                 'boulders, a dog, the body of a dog, "seaspawn and seawrack." '
                 "The next twelve chapters take the reader on Leopold Bloom's "
                 "Odyssey (the wanderings of Ulysses). His and Stephen's paths "
                 'cross but they have no meaningful meeting until later on. In '
                 "Chapter Four, Leopold Bloom is at his and Molly's home at 7 "
                 'Eccles Street in the northwest quadrant of Dublin. He is '
                 'preparing breakfast for himself and his wife (and his cat) '
                 "before departing for Paddy Dignam's funeral. The jingling "
                 'springs of the bed upstairs show that his wife Molly is '
                 'awake. He goes out into the world like Odysseus in The '
                 "Odyssey. Bloom's wanderings become the major part of the "
                 'novel. In Chapter Five, Bloom walks through the streets of '
                 'Dublin and performs several errands. In Chapter Six, Bloom '
                 'and his fellow mourners travel to the cemetery for the '
                 'burial of Paddy Dignam, which evokes from Bloom a wealth of '
                 'meditations on birth, death, and human frailty, including '
                 'his reminiscences on Rudy, his own dead son, and his father, '
                 'a suicide. This theme and anti-Semitism, tactlessly arise in '
                 'various conversations, with Bloom the target. In Chapter '
                 'Seven, Stephen and Bloom (father and son, or Odysseus and '
                 'Telemachus) meet in the newspaper office for the first time '
                 'in the novel, although each knows who the other is. Bloom '
                 'attempts (unsuccessfully) to complete an advertising '
                 'contract, and Stephen (successfully) hands over the letter '
                 'schoolmaster Deasy entrusted him with. Note the shift in '
                 'narrative as newspaper headlines appear to interrupt '
                 'straightforward narrative. In Chapter Eight, Bloom gets '
                 "hungry and decides to lunch at Davey Byrnes's pub. The "
                 'dominant motifs are related to food and eating. Bloom '
                 'continues to wander, thinking about birth and family life, '
                 'Molly, her previous lovers, and his own past. He is handed a '
                 "religious pamphlet, sees Stephen's sister Dilly in the "
                 'street, feeds some seagulls with cakes he has purchased, '
                 'then starts noticing and thinking about advertising. Bloom '
                 'meets Mrs. Breen, sort of an old flame, and sympathizes with '
                 'her because of her "cracked" husband. (He had earlier '
                 "sympathized with women's lot in general when thinking about "
                 'families — "Life with hard labor.") He learns that a mutual '
                 'acquaintance, Mrs. Purefoy, is in the maternity hospital. In '
                 'Chapter Nine, at the National Library, in the office of the '
                 'director, Stephen, A.E. (the pseudonym of noted Irish man of '
                 'letters, George Russell), John Eglinton, and Lyster the '
                 'librarian discuss Shakespeare. The others mock Stephen for '
                 'his youthful enthusiasm for complex theories of literary '
                 'creation. A.E. is a Platonist (an idealist), and mocks all '
                 'readings of Shakespeare that suppose that Hamlet is a real '
                 'person. After some banter about the Dublin literati, A.E. '
                 'leaves and Stephen begins to expound his theory (it is a '
                 'theory that must chart a course between the idealism of A.E. '
                 'and the simple-minded, literal approach of Mulligan in order '
                 'to define the ways in which art [the ideal] and life [the '
                 'material] interact). Chapter Ten takes place at about 3:00 '
                 "p.m. on the streets of Dublin. It's made up of eighteen "
                 'small episodes, which makes it a sort of doubling of the '
                 'book itself (which has eighteen chapters). In these '
                 'mini-episodes, we meet Father Conmee, the Dedalus sisters, '
                 'and Stephen (who, at the sight of one of his sisters, is '
                 'wracked with guilt because she is so obviously in poor '
                 'financial straits and he is doing nothing to help her), a '
                 'one-legged sailor, and an arm that throws a coin and belongs '
                 'to Molly Bloom. We also meet Blazes Boylan, and a host of '
                 'other characters. In Chapter Eleven, it is about 4:00 in the '
                 "afternoon, nearly time for Boylan's assignation with Molly. "
                 'We are at The Concert Room Saloon in the posh Ormond Hotel. '
                 'The barmaids at the Ormond Hotel see Bloom pass by. Simon '
                 "Dedalus, Stephen's father, is there, and he turns his "
                 'attention to the piano, which has just been tuned by the '
                 'blind stripling. Bloom is elsewhere, buying paper. Boylan '
                 'enters. Bloom spots his car outside and also enters with a '
                 'friend, Ritchie Goulding. Boylan leaves, on his way to meet '
                 'Molly. Simon sings, and Bloom thinks of Molly. In Chapter '
                 'Twelve, it is nearly 5:00 and the locale shifts to Barney '
                 "Kiernan's pub, where Bloom is going to meet Martin "
                 'Cunningham and discuss the affairs of the Dignam family. The '
                 'unnamed narrator (a debt collector) chats with Joe Hynes, '
                 'and they meet the Citizen, a fierce nationalist with a dog '
                 'called Garryowen, who does not take kindly to Bloom. Several '
                 'characters enter the pub, including Bloom, behind whose back '
                 'the Citizen starts throwing insults. Chapter Thirteen takes '
                 'place at 8:00 p.m. Cissy Caffrey, her twin brothers, and her '
                 'friends Edy Boardman and Gerty MacDowell (who sits a little '
                 'apart), are on the Sandymount Strand. Gerty is impatient '
                 'with the boys and their noise and mess, as well as her '
                 'friends, who are a little common, and she daydreams at '
                 'length about herself, her romantic aspirations, and her '
                 'spiritual strivings. The twins kick their ball to Bloom, who '
                 'is also on the beach, and Gerty weaves him into her thoughts '
                 '(she notices that he is in mourning and constructs a tragic '
                 'but romantic tale around him). Cissy cockily goes to ask '
                 'Bloom the time, but his watch has stopped. A fireworks '
                 'display begins. Her friends run along the beach, but Gerty '
                 'stays near Bloom and leans back to watch the fireworks (she '
                 'knows that men can be excited by immodest women, and she is '
                 'allowing Bloom to see up her skirt). When she leaves, Bloom '
                 'notices that she has a limp, and we learn that he has '
                 'masturbated. In Chapter Fourteen, at 10:00, Bloom enters The '
                 'National Maternity Hospital to check on the condition of '
                 'Mina Purefoy, who went into labor in Chapter Eight. To '
                 'reinforce the theme of childbearing, Joyce delivers a '
                 'running analogy between the development of the English '
                 'language and the gestation of an infant. While at the '
                 'hospital, Bloom sees Stephen carousing with other young men '
                 'and worries that doing so will spill and waste the seed of '
                 'his talent. In Chapter Fifteen, it is midnight at Bella '
                 "Cohen's brothel on Tyrone Street. This chapter is a series "
                 'of fantastic events, partially the result of drunkenness on '
                 "Steven's part, partially due to hallucinations induced by "
                 "guilt and remorse on Bloom's part. Stephen and Lynch stagger "
                 'in drunk and are mocked by the hangers-on and patrons of the '
                 'place. Bloom follows, events and characters (Gerty, Molly, '
                 'his father, and his mother) stimulating his mind and sense '
                 'of guilt in a hallucinatory fashion. Bloom is arrested for '
                 'committing an unnamed nuisance and undergoes a protracted '
                 'trial in which he never knows for certain what the charges '
                 'are. His identity constantly changes as characters from his '
                 'past and personifications of perverse desires enter the '
                 'court. Bloom speaks with one of the whores, Zoe Higgins, who '
                 'knows where Stephen is. When Bloom finds him, Stephen, in '
                 'his drunkenness, is attempting to settle his bill. Bloom '
                 "ensures that he isn't cheated. The ghost of Stephen's mother "
                 'appears, Stephen breaks the chandelier, and they end up on '
                 'the street. A fight with some English privates (he has '
                 'allegedly insulted the King) leaves Stephen prostrate on the '
                 'pavement. The police appear, but Corny Kelleher and Bloom '
                 'smooth things over. Bloom gazes at the unconscious Stephen '
                 'and experiences a vision of his dead son, Rudy. The '
                 "remaining three chapters, may be seen as Ulysses' homecoming "
                 'to Ithaca. These segments cover the following events from '
                 "The Odyssey: the hero's return, his slaying of the "
                 'treacherous suitors of his faithful wife Penelope, and his '
                 'joyful reunion with her. In Chapter Sixteen, it is 1:00 at a '
                 "cabman's shelter. Bloom and Stephen drink coffee. A number "
                 'of minor characters appear, and Stephen and Bloom interact '
                 'with them. Bloom shows Stephen a photograph of Molly, the '
                 "implication being that Stephen's talents might be used to "
                 "further Molly's career (and thus oust Boylan from her "
                 'affections). They leave and discuss music as they walk. In '
                 "Chapter Seventeen, it is 2:00 in the morning at the Bloom's "
                 'home at 7 Eccles Street. The narrative style is in the dry, '
                 'question-and-answer style of the catechism. Stephen and '
                 'Bloom are brought together for the last time here. Stephen '
                 'seeks a father, Bloom seeks a son. At the same time, each of '
                 'them is individual, yet harmoniously joined. In the text, '
                 'they are united by a word play, becoming "Stoom and '
                 'Blephen," but their union or reconciliation is ephemeral. '
                 'They urinate in the garden, Bloom invites Stephen to stay, '
                 'Stephen declines and leaves. In Chapter Eighteen, called '
                 '"Molly\'s Soliloquy," Molly is in bed, just on the cusp of '
                 "sleep. The entire chapter is from Molly's point of view, "
                 "revealing Molly's thoughts. She is thinking about her "
                 'husband, her meeting with Boylan earlier that day (in that '
                 'very bed), her past, her hopes. Among other things, she '
                 "suspects Bloom of having an affair, she thinks of woman's "
                 'lot in the games of courting and mating, she thinks of her '
                 'lovers, and she longs for a glamorous life. She thinks of '
                 'beauty and ugliness, and her thoughts are interrupted by a '
                 'train whistle. She thinks of her past life in Gibraltar and '
                 'laments the drabness of her present. She thinks about her '
                 'health and her daughter, she thinks about her visits to the '
                 'doctor, and muses about Stephen. Her thoughts turn to Rudy '
                 'and Bloom. She thinks of humiliating her husband, she '
                 'recalls the time when she and Bloom first made love, letting '
                 'the reader see she clearly prefers Bloom to Boylan. '
                 'Punctuation, selection, comment, things usually associated '
                 'with authorial control, are missing. Those familiar with The '
                 'Odyssey will see the ironic comparison between Molly Bloom '
                 'and with Penelope, who uses her knowledge of the '
                 "construction of hers and Ulysses' bed to confirm the "
                 'identity of her long-absent husband. This chapter begins and '
                 "ends with the affirmative Yes. The yeses represent Molly's "
                 'ongoing optimism to life in general, punctuating the choices '
                 'she has made and the memories she has revisited during the '
                 "entire soliloquy. The yesses also represent Joyce's belief "
                 'that women are a positive life force, a notion he was at '
                 'pains to demonstrate in this remarkable soliloquy. The key '
                 "here is to be found in Molly's ultimate decision to serve "
                 'Bloom breakfast in bed tomorrow.',

{'author': 'Ben Jonson',
 'book_title': 'Volpone',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Volpone, a Venetian nobleman, has no relative to make his '
                 'heir; he must name someone his beneficiary. Several rivals '
                 'try to attain his favor by bringing the sick Volpone gifts '
                 'that they hope will be returned tenfold. Mosca, a clever '
                 'parasite to Volpone, encourages the three major gulls to '
                 'give until it hurts. These birds of prey are Voltore, a '
                 'lawyer; Corbaccio, an old miser about to die himself; and '
                 'Corvino, a rich merchant and husband to Celia, a beautiful '
                 "lady of Venice. Also naively competing for Volpone's wealth "
                 'is Lady Would-be, the affected wife of an English knight, '
                 'Sir Politic Would-be. After each gull is fleeced before our '
                 'eyes, Mosca encourages Volpone to think of seeking a greater '
                 'treasure than gold: the wife of Corvino. After a sensuous '
                 'description by Mosca, Volpone resolves to see this paragon '
                 'of beauty. As the second act begins, Volpone appears beneath '
                 "Celia's window disguised as a mountebank. Jealous Corvino "
                 'drives him away upon discovering his wife in an upper '
                 'window. While Corvino threatens his wife with closer '
                 'incarceration, Volpone sings to Mosca of her beauty and his '
                 'desire. Mosca hatches a plot to secure Celia for his master. '
                 "He tells Corvino that the mountebank's oil, purchased for "
                 'Volpone by Corbaccio, has revived the flagging health of the '
                 'fox. However, if Volpone is to live on, he must sleep with '
                 'some young woman. The others are seeking the cure for '
                 'Volpone, and Corvino must hurry or lose his investment. '
                 'Corvino wisely suggests a courtesan, but Mosca slyly rejects '
                 'this plan, reasoning that an artful quean might cheat them '
                 'all. Finally, Corvino offers his wife. He is convinced that '
                 'she is safe, and Mosca is sent to tell Volpone the good '
                 'news. Act III reveals Mosca and Bonario conversing in the '
                 'street. For some reason, Mosca is telling Bonario of '
                 "Corbaccio's intention to disinherit him and inviting the son "
                 "to witness the deed at Volpone's house. Meanwhile, Lady "
                 'Would-be visits Volpone and nearly talks him to death. Mosca '
                 'gets rid of her by saying that Sir Politic was lately seen '
                 'rowing in a gondola with a cunning courtesan. Corvino '
                 "arrives, dragging his unwilling wife into the fox's lair; "
                 'Volpone, left alone with the shrinking lady, is not '
                 'successful in his persuasive attempts to seduce her. Just as '
                 'he is about to take her by force, Bonario leaps from his '
                 'hiding place and denounces Volpone and spirits the lady to '
                 'safety. Mosca saves Volpone from the police by explaining '
                 'the incident to the three gulls and persuading them to tell '
                 'his contrived story in court. Mosca says that Bonario, '
                 'impatient to see Volpone, discovered the fox with Celia, '
                 'seized the lady, and made her swear that Volpone had '
                 'attempted to rape her. The plan is to get an injunction '
                 'against Bonario. Act IV begins with the subplot of Sir '
                 'Politic Would-be and Peregrine. Sir Politic is discovered '
                 'entertaining his fellow Englishman with his naive '
                 'understanding of politics. Lady Would-be interrupts the '
                 'conversation and mistakes Peregrine for the courtesan. She '
                 'apologizes upon discovering her mistake, but Peregrine '
                 'leaves in a huff and promises to take his revenge for the '
                 'affront. At the court, Voltore succeeds in making Celia and '
                 'Bonario look like lovers. Mosca persuades Lady Would-be to '
                 'testify that Celia was the bawd in the gondola with her '
                 'husband. Volpone makes his entrance on a stretcher to '
                 'demonstrate his impotence. All augurs well for the rogues as '
                 'the fifth act begins. But Volpone cannot leave well enough '
                 'alone. He sends his servants to announce his demise and '
                 'waits for the gulls to come to claim their inheritance. '
                 'Mosca is the heir! The parasite flaunts his knowledge of '
                 'their wrongdoing to the birds of prey and they leave in '
                 'despair. Disguised as a police officer, Volpone follows them '
                 'to taunt them further. Meanwhile, Peregrine, disguised as a '
                 "merchant, comes to Sir Politic's house and tells the knight "
                 'that the police are seeking him because he has plotted to '
                 'overthrow the Venetian state. When Sir Politic hides in a '
                 'tortoise shell, Peregrine calls in some other merchants to '
                 'mock and humiliate the foolish Englishman. At the court, the '
                 'three gulls, enraged by Mosca and Volpone and the loss of '
                 'their hopes, decide to tell the truth. They accuse Mosca of '
                 'being the lying villain who created the whole plot. Mosca is '

 'summary_text': 'Fifty-seven-year-old Landon Carter narrates the novel, '
                 'reflecting on events from 40 years in the past. The novel '
                 'opens with a Prologue, in which the older Landon, living in '
                 'the same North Carolina town as he did at the age of 17, '
                 'stands near the Baptist church that figures prominently in '
                 'the novel and gets himself in the mindset of his 17-year-old '
                 'self. The story begins in 1958 and is, Landon tells us, both '
                 'joyful and sad. Seventeen-year-old Landon is a senior at '
                 'Beaufort High School, which collaborates each year with '
                 'Southern Baptist Church on a Christmas play called The '
                 'Christmas Angel. The play, written by Reverend Hegbert '
                 'Sullivan, the minister of the church, tells the story of a '
                 'man who is so grief-stricken over the death of his wife '
                 '(while giving birth to their only child) that he is not much '
                 'of a father to his child. An angel appears to the man, and '
                 'she admonishes him to be a better father; she also performs '
                 'a small miracle for the family on Christmas morning. The '
                 'popular play, performed in the local playhouse, features '
                 "seniors from the high school. Landon's father is a "
                 'congressman who spends most of his life in Washington, D.C., '
                 "and is a stranger to his son. Landon's grandfather, who is "
                 'now deceased, was a bootlegger and banker during the Great '
                 'Depression, and he built the Carter family fortune by '
                 "preying on the poor. One of Grandfather Carter's employees "
                 'was Reverend Sullivan, who still harbors resentments against '
                 'the Carters. Like the narrative of The Christmas Angel, '
                 "Reverend Sullivan's wife died during childbirth, and he has "
                 'raised his daughter, Jamie, on his own. Jamie and her father '
                 'are deeply connected, but Jamie is ostracized by her '
                 'classmates because of her religious devotion, unflattering '
                 'clothing and hairstyle, and tendency to help the '
                 'downtrodden. Although Landon has known Jamie most of his '
                 'life — as classmates and fellow church members only — he is '
                 'surprised to notice at the beginning of his senior year that '
                 'she is becoming a woman and could almost be considered '
                 'attractive. Early in his senior year, Landon is elected '
                 'student body president and must attend the upcoming '
                 'Homecoming Dance. Mortified by the idea of attending without '
                 'a date, Landon invites Jamie, who dresses nicely and does '
                 'not carry the Bible she usually always has with her. The '
                 'evening ends eventfully when Jamie and Landon find '
                 "themselves cleaning up after and taking care of Landon's "
                 'former girlfriend, who has gotten drunk. Some weeks later, '
                 'Jamie asks Landon to play the part of the father in the '
                 'Christmas play; she has already been cast as the angel. '
                 'Landon reluctantly agrees. The two begin spending time '
                 'together — although Landon does so only out of obligation — '
                 'but in the course of their conversations, Landon discovers '
                 "that Jamie's only goal in life is to get married with a "
                 'church full of people in attendance, an unlikely occurrence '
                 "given Jamie's social status. Landon finds this goal odd for "
                 'such an excellent student as Jamie, who could have far '
                 'loftier aspirations; he is especially surprised that she '
                 'does not plan to attend college. Landon visits an orphanage '
                 'with Jamie and sees one of her pet projects firsthand. '
                 'However, all their togetherness is frustrating for Landon, '
                 'and he bursts out angrily at Jamie the night before the play '
                 "performance, telling her he hasn't enjoyed any of their time "
                 'together. Jamie is visibly hurt. Landon apologizes the next '
                 'evening and, for reasons inexplicable to him, holds her hand '
                 'during the apology. The play is a great success, and in a '
                 'pivotal scene, in which the father is supposed to notice the '
                 'ravishing beauty of the angel, Landon is shocked by how '
                 'beautiful Jamie looks in her white dress; she is wearing a '
                 'touch of makeup and has taken her long hair out of a bun and '
                 'let it fall past her shoulders. The other students in the '
                 "school are as surprised by Jamie's appearance as Landon is, "
                 'but her upgraded social status does not last, and Jamie is '
                 'soon relegated to her former social status. Jamie asks '
                 'Landon to help her collect the bottles and cans she set out '
                 'in a donation drive to buy presents for the orphans. '
                 'Astonished by the paltry donations, Landon empties his own '
                 'bank account and adds those funds to the collection without '
                 'telling anyone what he has done. With this decision to help '
                 'Jamie and the orphans in this way, Landon surprises himself. '
                 'Jamie buys gifts for the orphans and invites Landon to the '
                 'orphanage Christmas party; while there, Landon is deeply '
                 "touched by both the starkness of the orphan's surroundings "
                 'and by the deep connection Jamie shares with the young '
                 'orphans. He is also surprised by how beautiful she looks; he '
                 'cannot take his eyes off her. Landon soon realizes he has '
                 'fallen in love with Jamie. Landon invites Jamie to eat '
                 "Christmas dinner at his family's historic and beautiful "
                 'mansion; afterward, he asks Jamie whether he can begin '
                 'seeing her regularly. She agrees. The next day, they kiss '
                 'for the first time, and the two begin dating. Landon '
                 'notices, however, that Jamie is often fatigued and cold, and '
                 'even has some bruising on her body. When Landon tells Jamie '
                 'that he loves her, she realizes that she must tell him her '
                 'stunning news: She is dying of a rare form of leukemia and '
                 'has only a few months to live. Landon is devastated, but he '
                 'works through his fear and sadness and begins to pray for a '
                 'miracle. His prayers soon lead him to ponder his purpose in '
                 'life as he searches for a response to the feeling in his '
                 "heart that there is some role for him in Jamie's illness, "
                 'something for him to do. Landon soon discovers that purpose '
                 'and asks Jamie to marry him, even in her weakened state. She '
                 'agrees, and just as in her vision of her wedding day, '
                 "hundreds of guests turn out for her wedding. Jamie's slow, "
                 'painful walk down the aisle is, indeed, "a walk to '
                 'remember." In the last chapter of the novel, 57-year-old '
                 'Landon reflects on the 40 years that have passed since his '
                 'wedding to Jamie. He still loves her and has not removed his '
                 'wedding ring in all those years. When he reveals that he now '
                 'believes in miracles, readers are left to ponder the ending: '
                 'Did Jamie die, or did a miracle save her life?',

 'summary_text': 'Arthur Shelby, a Kentucky farmer and slaveowner, is forced '
                 'by debt to sell two slaves — Uncle Tom and Harry, the young '
                 "son of his wife's servant Eliza — to a trader named Haley. "
                 'Eliza hears the discussion, warns Tom and his wife, and runs '
                 'away with her child, followed by Haley, who is prevented '
                 'from catching her when she crosses the Ohio River and is '
                 'aided by helpful citizens. Haley meets two slave-catchers '
                 'who agree to pursue Eliza and Harry. Meanwhile Tom refuses '
                 'to run away and is taken by Haley toward New Orleans. Before '
                 'leaving Kentucky, however, Haley buys several more slaves, '
                 'and one of them (a young mother whose infant Haley sells '
                 'without her knowledge) commits suicide. Some time later, '
                 "Eliza's husband, George Harris, himself an escaped slave in "
                 'disguise, discovers that Eliza is headed for Canada and sets '
                 'out to find and join her. Meanwhile, Eliza and her son have '
                 'been taken in by a Quaker family and are joined by George to '
                 'prepare for the next stage of their escape. Tom, on a '
                 'Mississippi river boat, meets a little white girl named Eva '
                 'St. Clare, is touched by her beauty and gravity, and rescues '
                 "her from drowning. Eva's father buys Tom from Haley at Eva's "
                 'request, and Tom accompanies the family (father, daughter, '
                 'and cousin Ophelia) to their New Orleans home. There he '
                 "meets Eva's mother, a spoiled and bigoted woman, and other "
                 'slaves belonging to the household. He and Eva form a close '
                 'relationship; by reading to Tom from his Bible, Eva herself '
                 'grows to understand and love Christianity. George and Eliza '
                 'Harris, with their child and two other escaped slaves, are '
                 'being driven to the next stop on their journey when pursuers '
                 'overtake them. George wounds one with his pistol; the rest '
                 'of the posse flees. Eliza persuades the others to bring the '
                 'wounded man with them to be treated. Back in New Orleans, '
                 'Tom has been given the responsibility of marketing for the '
                 "St. Clare household. St. Clare writes a letter to Tom's wife "
                 "in Kentucky, informing her of Tom's whereabouts and "
                 'well-being. St. Clare also buys a young slave girl called '
                 'Topsy and "gives" her to Ophelia to raise. Back in Kentucky, '
                 "Tom's wife, Chloe, convinces Mrs. Shelby that Chloe should "
                 'be hired out to a confectionary baker in Louisville and her '
                 "wages saved to buy Tom's freedom. The Shelbys' son, George, "
                 'writes back to Tom with this news. After two years, it '
                 'becomes apparent to Tom — and soon to others — that Eva is '
                 'terminally ill. Her father refuses to see the truth of this. '
                 "But after a visit from St. Clare's plantation-owner brother "
                 "and the brother's young son, Eva's condition worsens, and "
                 'St. Clare finally must accept the knowledge that she is '
                 'dying. As death approaches, Eva touches the hearts of all '
                 'around her, even Topsy, with her sweet Christian acceptance, '
                 "and when she dies, everyone mourns her. Tom's influence at "
                 'this point brings St. Clare almost to belief in Christ, and '
                 'the man promises Tom his freedom, signs Topsy over to '
                 'Ophelia legally, and begins to make provisions to protect '
                 'all of his slaves from sale, should something happen to him. '
                 'But then St. Clare is killed suddenly, and his wife sells '
                 "most of his servants, including Tom. Tom's new owner is "
                 'Simon Legree, a plantation owner, who also buys two women, '
                 "one intended as the sexual slave of Legree's black overseer "
                 'Sambo, the other (a 15-year-old named Emmeline) for Legree '
                 "himself. They are taken to the man's run-down plantation "
                 'among the swamps. Tom is set to picking cotton, and he tries '
                 'to make the best of his position by prayer and hope. He '
                 "meets Cassy, Legree's black concubine, and learns her "
                 'horrifying story. Tom is whipped mercilessly for attempting '
                 'to help his fellow slaves, and Legree vows to break his '
                 'spirit or kill him. Cassy does her best to use her influence '
                 'to save Tom. Back in the Midwest, Tom Loker has warned the '
                 'Quakers that Eliza and her family are being sought at the '
                 'Lake Erie port where they expect to cross into Canada, so '
                 'Eliza disguises herself and is not recognized. She, George, '
                 'and Harry cross into freedom. But Tom, in the months that '
                 'follow his beating, loses heart and nearly his faith, until '
                 'at the lowest ebb of his life he is given the grace to '
                 "prevail in spirit against Legree's torture. He brings his "
                 'own spiritual strength to the other slaves, and Cassy '
                 'devises a way for her and Emmeline to escape. The two women '
                 "hide in Legree's own garret while the man searches the "
                 'swamps for them. Legree questions Tom, who knows their plan '
                 'but refuses to tell. Legree has Sambo and the other overseer '
                 'whip Tom until he is near death; finally Legree gives up, '
                 'and the dying Tom forgives him and the two men who whipped '
                 "him. George Shelby, arrived to buy Tom's freedom, is in time "
                 'only to hear his last words. But Cassy and Emmeline have '
                 'made good their escape, and they meet George on the '
                 'riverboat going north. Another lady on the boat reveals that '
                 "she is George Harris's sister, and Cassy recognizes that "
                 "George's wife Eliza is her own daughter. The two, with "
                 'Emmeline, go to Canada and find George, Eliza, and their '
                 'children; they all eventually go to France, return, and plan '
                 'to emigrate to Liberia. Meanwhile George Shelby returns to '
                 'his farm, where his father has died, breaks the news to '
                 "Chloe of Tom's death, and frees all his slaves, telling them "
                 'to remember that they owe their freedom to the influence of '
                 'Uncle Tom.',

                 "better judgment by honoring his commitment. George's "
                 "opposition to his son's financially unprofitable match leads "
                 'Theobald to rationalize that his entering into a loveless '
                 'marriage is a noble act. Unlike his father in almost every '
                 'other way, Theobald is very like him as an authoritarian. He '
                 'is determined to seek out and destroy the least sign of '
                 'individuality in any of his children, and it is the oldest '
                 'child, Ernest, who is made to suffer the frontal wave of his '
                 'assault. Ernest is beaten for mispronouncing words, denied '
                 'pocket money, and given "pleasure" by being allowed to '
                 'select his own hymn to sing at Sunday evening service. '
                 'Although his mother is far better natured and gentler than '
                 'Theobald, she eventually alienates Ernest by betraying his '
                 'confidences to Theobald, who promptly administers punishment '
                 "to his son. Neither Ernest's younger brother nor sister is "
                 'the kind of playmate who can alleviate the harsh domestic '
                 "regime, for they invariably submit to their parents' "
                 'demands. Only the household servants provide Ernest with '
                 'pleasurable companionship. At age twelve, Ernest enters '
                 'Roughborough School, whose headmaster, Dr. Skinner, treats '
                 'his charges much the same way that Theobald treats his '
                 'children. Ernest is apathetic in his studies, dislikes '
                 'athletics, begins to smoke and drink, but is not unpopular '
                 "with his schoolmates. When Ernest's Aunt Alethea moves to "
                 'Roughborough, she provides Ernest relief from his depressing '
                 'existence by arranging lessons in carpentry for him and '
                 'brightening his drab life with her cheerful company. '
                 'Unfortunately, she is suddenly stricken with typhoid fever '
                 'and dies; she arranges her will, however, so that Ernest '
                 'will receive most of her sizable estate on his twenty-eighth '
                 'birthday. Another misfortune befalls Ernest when he is home '
                 'during a long vacation. Ellen, a friendly and charming '
                 'servant girl at Battersby, is dismissed from service by '
                 'Theobald when she is discovered to be pregnant. Christina '
                 'half hopes that Ernest is the father, but he is innocent; he '
                 'is guilty, however, of having given Ellen all his personal '
                 'possessions of any value to help her on her way. When '
                 "Theobald discovers Ernest's act, he forces a confession from "
                 'Ernest and then extorts knowledge from him of his and the '
                 "other schoolboys' vices at Roughborough. Ernest is agonized "
                 'at having to tell tales out of school, and after he returns '
                 'to Roughborough, he is severely punished by Dr. Skinner. The '
                 'other boys readily forgive him, however, when he voluntarily '
                 'admits his perfidy, and they gain revenge on Theobald by '
                 "burning him in effigy on Guy Fawke's day, ironically the day "
                 "of Ernest's confirmation. After completing his studies at "
                 'Roughborough, Ernest enters Emmanual College of Cambridge '
                 'University; there he enjoys a new freedom, gains at least a '
                 'modest reputation as an intellectual, and takes an honors '
                 'degree. Unfortunately, after showing flashes of distinctive '
                 'literary gifts and a sense of humor, Ernest falls under the '
                 'influence of the Simeonites, a small group of '
                 'evangelistically fervent students. When he writes to his '
                 'parents of his religious ardor, they are more frightened '
                 'than amused; Theobald nonetheless insists that his son take '
                 'religious orders, and Ernest complies. Ernest requests and '
                 'subsequently receives an appointment as a junior curate in a '
                 'London parish which is populated by the lower classes who '
                 'are, for the most part, indifferent to religion. Under the '
                 'spell of a slightly older curate, Pryer, Ernest hopes to '
                 'found a College of Spiritual Pathology to treat disorders of '
                 'the soul in much the same manner as physicians treat '
                 'ailments of the body. Unfortunately, Ernest entrusts a small '
                 'inheritance to Pryer for speculation in the stock market — '
                 'the intended profits of this venture will enable them to '
                 "advance God's work in the world more quickly. Unable to "
                 'contain his enthusiasm, however, Ernest begins a private '
                 'evangelical campaign of his own within the confines of his '
                 'Ashpit Place boarding house. He is rebuffed at every clumsy '
                 'attempt to gain converts; the culmination of his efforts is '
                 'a complete fiasco, for he mistakes a decent young woman for '
                 'a prostitute, approaches her boldly, and promptly finds '
                 'himself put under arrest for attempted assault. In spite of '
                 'the efforts of his godfather, Edward Overton, and a college '
                 'acquaintance, Towneley, Ernest is sentenced to serve six '
                 'months at hard labor in Coldbath Fields Prison. Upon '
                 'reaching prison, Ernest suffers an attack of brain fever and '
                 'remains bedfast for two months. Once he is sufficiently '
                 'recovered, Ernest is apprenticed to the prison tailor and is '
                 "given the post of chapel organist. He learns of Pryer's "
                 "absconding with his inheritance and his father's "
                 'renunciation of him at the same time. The prison chaplain '
                 'gives him practical advice and makes no attempt to dissuade '
                 'Ernest from leaving the ministry. By the time his sentence '
                 'is completed, Ernest has not only renounced Christianity but '
                 'his parents as well, telling them to think of him as one who '
                 'is dead. With the help of Overton, Ernest reenters the world '
                 'but is unsuccessful in his attempts to gain employment as a '
                 'tailor. A chance meeting with Ellen, the servant discharged '
                 'by Theobald when Ernest was yet at Roughborough, gives him '
                 'the idea of opening a used-clothing shop, a line of work in '
                 'which Ellen is experienced. Ernest quickly becomes '
                 'infatuated with Ellen, who is extremely attractive despite '
                 'having led a dissolute life in London. Overton is upset by '
                 "Ernest's determination to marry her but advances the young "
                 'couple money for the leasing of a shop which also provides '
                 'living quarters. Both the marriage and the business prosper '
                 'at first, but when Ellen tires of her role as the wife of a '
                 'well-educated and refined husband, she begins to drink '
                 'heavily, a practice which she artfully conceals from Ernest. '
                 'He attributes her strange behavior to being with child, and '
                 'only after she lapses into drinking a second time, when '
                 'carrying her second child, does the naive Ernest understand '
                 'the true cause of her distress. Resigned to a burdensome '
                 'marriage and almost certain penury, Ernest suddenly gains '
                 "relief upon hearing the testimony of her father's former "
                 "coachman who left Battersby at the time of Ellen's "
                 'dismissal. The testimony, to the effect that the coachman '
                 'and Ellen had earlier married, prompts Ernest to arrange a '
                 'separation from his supposed wife and to place his children '
                 "first in the care of Overton's laundress and later in a "
                 'foster home. With less than two years remaining before '
                 "Ernest is to receive his Aunt Alethea's legacy, now grown to "
                 'a considerable fortune, Overton decides that his godson has '
                 "suffered enough and employs him as his secretary. Ernest's "
                 'main duty is to manage the sums of money which, unknown to '
                 "him, are soon to be his own. Ernest's shock and surprise "
                 'when he comes into his fortune is matched only by that of '
                 "Theobald. Called to his dying mother's bedside, Ernest does "
                 'not flaunt his wealth; he acts firmly with his father and '
                 "gently indulges his mother's concerns for her "
                 'soul-worthiness. The reconciliation with his parents rounds '
                 "out Ernest's prolonged and harassing process of maturation. "
                 'Financially able to do as he pleases, Ernest first goes '
                 'abroad for a number of years and then returns to set himself '
                 'up as an intellectual gadfly, determined to attack the shams '
                 'of a society which, willing or not, needs his corrective '
                 'treatment.',

{'author': 'Maxine Hong Kingston',
 'book_title': 'The Woman Warrior',
 'source': 'cliffnotes',
 'summary_text': 'Divided into five chapters, each of which is more or less '
                 "self-contained, Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior "
                 'explores the many forms of adversity that women face. '
                 "Kingston uses women's stories to explore her own cultural "
                 'history. As a first-generation Chinese American, she '
                 'struggles to reconcile her Chinese cultural heritage with '
                 'her emerging sense of herself as an American. In the '
                 'memoir\'s first chapter, "No Name Woman," Kingston\'s '
                 'mother, Brave Orchid, tells her daughter about an aunt on '
                 "Kingston's father's side of the family. This aunt, whom "
                 'Kingston names No Name Woman because her real name is never '
                 'spoken by the family, becomes pregnant while her husband is '
                 'working in America. When No Name Woman no longer can hide '
                 'her pregnancy from her family and her village, the villagers '
                 'destroy the family home as punishment for her adultery. '
                 'After giving birth in a pigsty, she kills herself and the '
                 'baby by drowning in the family well. In the second chapter, '
                 '"White Tigers," Kingston recalls the legend of Fa Mu Lan, a '
                 'woman warrior who leads her people to victory in battle. As '
                 'a child, Kingston felt girls could not achieve greatness in '
                 'a man\'s world. "White Tigers" is the story of her own '
                 'childhood fantasy of overcoming feelings of inferiority as a '
                 'female. Like Fa Mu Lan, she imagines herself leaving home at '
                 'seven years of age and being brought up by martial arts '
                 'teachers. She becomes a great warrior, triumphantly '
                 'returning to her home to save her people. "Shaman" relates '
                 "the story of Brave Orchid's extraordinary medical career as "
                 'a midwife in China. After giving birth to two children in '
                 'China, Brave Orchid takes the unusual step of attending '
                 'medical school, after which she works as a doctor in her '
                 'home village and becomes a very successful healer. '
                 'Eventually, she gives up her career to join her husband in '
                 'America. However, unable to practice medicine in America, '
                 'she and her husband open a laundry business in California. '
                 'As The Woman Warrior progresses, Kingston relies less on her '
                 "mother's narratives and more on her own recollections of "
                 "family events and of experiences growing up. In the memoir's "
                 'fourth chapter, "At the Western Palace," she writes about '
                 'her aunt, Moon Orchid, who fails to assimilate into American '
                 "culture. Moon Orchid's husband arrived alone in America and "
                 'became a successful doctor. However, after many years of '
                 'practicing medicine in Los Angeles, he remarried and '
                 'abandoned Moon Orchid, who remained in Hong Kong waiting for '
                 'him to send for her. Brave Orchid, determined to have Moon '
                 'Orchid confront this irresponsible man, arranges for her '
                 'sister to immigrate to America, but when Moon Orchid finally '
                 'faces her husband, he again rejects her and chides her for '
                 'disrupting his life and career. Moon Orchid subsequently '
                 'goes mad, ending her days in an insane asylum. In the last '
                 'chapter, "A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe," in which '
                 'Kingston describes her childhood emotional experiences and '
                 'the conflicts she felt growing up in a Chinese household in '
                 'America, she depicts the pains of finding a personal '
                 'identity and a voice to express herself to her parents and a '
                 'society that do not understand her. She ends The Woman '
                 "Warrior with the legend of Ts'ai Yen, an ancient Chinese "
                 'female poet who was captured by a non-Chinese tribe and who '
                 'lived among these nomadic people for twelve years but could '
                 'never fully assimilate into their culture. Kingston strongly '
                 "implies that her mother is like Ts'ai Yen in that Brave "
                 'Orchid longs to return to her Chinese village, but Kingston '
                 'also suggests that she too sees herself as a foreigner among '
                 'Americans, caught between the Chinese traditions of her '
                 "parents and American culture's emphasis on individuality. "
                 "Her memoir is similar to Ts'ai Yen's cathartic song, which "
                 'the barbarians cannot understand: "Her words seemed to be '
                 'Chinese, but the barbarians understood their sadness and '
                 'anger."',

                 'Sicilia, talk about their respective countries. Archidamus '
                 'says that if Camillo were to visit Bohemia he would discover '
                 'great differences between their countries. Camillo replies '
                 'that he thinks that his king, Leontes, is planning a trip to '
                 'Bohemia in the summer. Abashed by how little Bohemia has to '
                 'offer in comparison to Sicilia, Archidamus imagines himself '
                 'serving drinks that would make the visitors so sleepy that '
                 'they would not notice the barrenness of Bohemia. The lords '
                 'also discuss the lifelong friendship of their two kings, as '
                 'well as the virtues of the two young princes. Camillo then '
                 'joins a group that is composed of the two kings, Leontes and '
                 "Polixenes, Leontes' family, and some attendants. Polixenes, "
                 'King of Bohemia, is thanking Leontes for his extended '
                 'hospitality in Sicilia and insisting that he, Polixenes, '
                 "must return to his country's responsibilities. When it is "
                 "clear that Polixenes will not yield to Leontes' entreaties "
                 'to stay for a longer visit, Leontes urges his wife, '
                 'Hermione, to join the effort. Hermione succeeds in '
                 'persuading Polixenes to stay. Leontes seems delighted that '
                 'Hermione has convinced Polixenes to stay, but suddenly he '
                 'reveals that he is jealous of Polixenes. Seeing that Leontes '
                 'is upset, Hermione and Polixenes ask him what is wrong. '
                 'Leontes, however, avoids a truthful answer by claiming that '
                 'he is merely remembering when he was the age of his son. The '
                 'two kings then compare their love for their sons. Leontes '
                 'takes a walk with his son, Mamillius, thinking that this '
                 'will set up Polixenes and Hermione for a compromising '
                 'situation. Hermione, however, innocently discloses where she '
                 'and Polixenes will be, and Leontes indulges in satiric '
                 'swipes at her imagined infidelity. Then he sends Mamillius '
                 "off to play, before asking for Camillo's assessment of the "
                 "relationship between Hermione and Polixenes. Camillo's "
                 'straightforward responses, however, are twisted by the '
                 'jealous king, and Camillo protests: The imagined bawdiness '
                 "which Leontes interprets from his wife's and Polixenes' "
                 'actions is wrong. The king lashes out at Camillo, and '
                 'Camillo humbly begs for a reappraisal of his reliability as '
                 'an observer for the king. When Leontes insists upon a '
                 "confirmation of Hermione's infidelity, a shocked Camillo "
                 'criticizes his king. Leontes then tries to extract an '
                 'agreement that his list of observed actions (between '
                 "Hermione and Polixenes) proves that his wife's and "
                 "Polixenes' affair is a reality. Camillo urges the king to "
                 'heal "this diseased opinion," but Leontes cannot be '
                 'convinced. He suggests that Camillo poison Polixenes. '
                 'Camillo admits that he could do it, but he states that he '
                 'will never believe that Hermione was unfaithful. Camillo '
                 'agrees to poison Polixenes if Leontes promises not to reveal '
                 'what he believes about Hermione. Leontes promises, then '
                 'joins the innocent couple. Alone, Camillo speaks of his '
                 'hopeless position. Approached by Polixenes to explain '
                 "Leontes' changed attitude, Camillo convinces Polixenes that "
                 'they must flee together or they will both be killed by '
                 'Leontes. Act II opens some time later with an obviously '
                 'pregnant Hermione resting in the company of her son, '
                 'Mamillius, and two ladies-in-waiting. When Hermione requests '
                 'a story, Mamillius suggests a tale about "sprites and '
                 'goblins," a tale suitable for winter. As Mamillius begins '
                 'the story, Leontes and Antigonus enter with a group of '
                 'attendants. Leontes clearly believes that the hasty '
                 'departure of Camillo and Polixenes is confirmation of his '
                 "suspicions about Hermione's affair with Polixenes. He orders "
                 'Mamillius to be kept away from his mother, and he accuses '
                 "Hermione of being pregnant by Polixenes. Ignoring Hermione's "
                 'protests, Leontes orders her to be imprisoned. She bravely '
                 'accepts her fate and exits with the guards. Beset by '
                 'protests from his astonished advisers, Leontes insists that '
                 'they refuse to see the evidence before them. The king quiets '
                 'the protesters by revealing that he has sent for an '
                 'interpretation from the oracle at Delphos. After the birth '
                 "of Hermione's baby (a girl), Paulina, the wife of one of the "
                 'lords of Sicilia, Antigonus, attempts to persuade Leontes to '
                 'retract his accusations as she presents his beautiful, '
                 'innocent baby to him. But she selects a poor time to '
                 'approach Leontes. He has just stated that killing Hermione '
                 'would allow him to sleep again, and he has resolved not to '
                 'worry about his sick son lest he be distracted from his '
                 'commitment to revenge. Paulina refuses to listen to the '
                 'warnings of her husband and her attendants. Instead, she '
                 'stubbornly tries to convince Leontes that the baby is his. '
                 'Leontes, however, responds as Paulina was warned he would. '
                 'Her arguments in favor of the queen and baby escalate his '
                 'tyranny. He then tries to pit Antigonus against Paulina, '
                 'ordering him to take the bastard child and Paulina away. '
                 'Antigonus protests that no man can control his wife. When '
                 'Leontes orders that the baby be thrown into a fire, '
                 'Antigonus negotiates a chance for the baby to live — if '
                 "Leontes will spare the baby's life, Antigonus promises to do "
                 'anything that Leontes requests. Vowing to kill both Paulina '
                 'and Antigonus if Antigonus fails to obey, Leontes orders '
                 'Antigonus to take the baby to a remote place and abandon her '
                 'to Fate. Antigonus doubts that this "fate" is better than a '
                 'quick death, but he agrees to leave the baby to the mercy of '
                 "wild animals, and he exits to carry out Leontes' command. No "
                 'sooner has Antigonus left than a servant announces the '
                 'return of the messengers from Delphos. Act III opens with '
                 'Cleomentes and Dion talking about the awesome experience '
                 'that they shared at Delphos. Both men hope that Apollo has '
                 'declared Hermione innocent, and they hurry off to deliver '
                 'the sealed message from the oracle. Leontes orders that his '
                 "wife be brought in to hear the reading of the oracle's "
                 'decision, fully expecting that she will be found guilty as '
                 'charged and, thus, he will be cleared from the stigma of '
                 'tyranny. Cleomentes and Dion swear that they have brought '
                 'the message from Delphos without breaking the sea. The '
                 'message declares that Hermione, Polixenes, Camillo and the '
                 'baby are all innocent. It further states that Leontes is "a '
                 'jealous tyrant" and asserts that "the King shall live '
                 'without an heir, if that which is lost be not found." '
                 'Leontes declares that the message contains no truth, and he '
                 'orders the trial to proceed. Just then, a servant announces '
                 'that Mamillius has died. Hermione seems to faint, and '
                 'Paulina announces that the news has killed the queen. '
                 'Leontes repents and orders Hermione to be tended to with the '
                 'belief that she will recover. He then announces his '
                 'intention to make peace with his old friend Polixenes, to '
                 'woo Hermione, and to recall Camillo. He declares Camillo a '
                 'good and faithful servant who was right to disobey his order '
                 'to poison Polixenes. Paulina enters, wailing over the death '
                 'of Hermione and attacking Leontes for his dreadful, '
                 'tyrannical edicts. She says that the king should embark on a '
                 'life of repentance as a result of what he has done to his '
                 'family. Leontes replies that he deserves all that she has '
                 'said and more. Paulina then expresses regret for her attack '
                 'because she detects the remorse that the king is feeling. '
                 'She says she will remind him no more of the death of '
                 'Hermione and his two children. Leontes asks that he be taken '
                 'to view the bodies of his dead wife and son. He declares '
                 'that they shall share the same tomb, and he vows that he '
                 'will visit the tomb each day to weep. In the next scene, we '
                 'discover that Antigonus and the infant are still alive, for '
                 'Antigonus is seeking assurance that his ship has indeed '
                 'arrived at "the deserts of Bohemia." He and a seaman look at '
                 'the sky and agree that a brewing storm may portend heavenly '
                 'anger if they abandon the helpless infant; they also agree '
                 'that they do not like their task. Antigonus promises to '
                 'hurry. Antigonus then describes his nightmare to the infant. '
                 'Her mother, he says, appeared to him in a dream, a figure of '
                 'sorrow. The dream figure requested that he leave the baby in '
                 'Bohemia and that he name her Perdita. Then she informed him '
                 'that because of this task, he would never again see his '
                 'wife. Antigonus concludes that Hermione is dead and that '
                 'Polixenes is the father of the baby. After uttering best '
                 'wishes for the baby and regret for his actions, Antigonus '
                 'runs off stage, chased by a bear. A shepherd enters, '
                 'despairing the wenching and fighting of all male youths '
                 'between the ages of ten and twenty-three. When he sees '
                 'Perdita, he assumes that she is an abandoned child born out '
                 'of wedlock. He pities the baby so much, though, that he '
                 'decides to keep her. The shepherd then calls for his son, '
                 'who is identified in the script only as "clown." The boy '
                 'tells his father about two sights that have shaken him — the '
                 'drowning of an entire crew of a ship (the one that brought '
                 'Antigonus and Perdita to Bohemia) and a man (Antigonus) '
                 "consumed by a bear. The shepherd turns his son's attention "
                 'to the baby, whom he surmises is, somehow, linked to a '
                 "fortune. The boy opens the baby's wrappings and discovers "
                 'gold. Urging his father to take the baby home, the boy is '
                 'inspired by their sudden good fortune to return and bury the '
                 'remains of Antigonus. The Chorus narrates that a bridge in '
                 'time occurs at the opening of Act IV, and it also summarizes '
                 'the highlights of an interim of sixteen years. Then, '
                 'Polixenes and Camillo enter in the middle of an argument '
                 "about Camillo's decision to return to Leontes after his long "
                 'sixteen-year separation. Polixcnes warns him that returning '
                 'could be fatal to Camillo. Besides, he needs Camillo. '
                 'Camillo, however, wants to return to his native country for '
                 'he is growing old, and he thinks that he can comfort the '
                 'now-repentant Leontes. Polixenes agrees that his penitent '
                 '"brother" has a sad history, but asks consideration for his '
                 'own sad lot — that is, having a son who is 11 ungracious." '
                 'Camillo acknowledges that he has not seen the prince '
                 '(Florizel) for three days and does not know where the young '
                 'man spends his time. The king says that he has been informed '
                 'that Florizel spends a good deal of time at the home of a '
                 'shepherd who has somehow acquired great wealth. They both '
                 "guess that Florizel must be attracted to the shepherd's "
                 'beautiful young daughter. Polixenes persuades Camillo to '
                 'help him discover what Florizel is up to. Autolycus then '
                 'enters, singing a song of hope and high spirits. He '
                 'identifies himself as a peddler of oddities, and also as one '
                 'who makes his living by cheating fools. On cue, the "clown" '
                 "(the shepherd's son) enters, trying to calculate his budget "
                 'and remember his shopping list for the upcoming '
                 'sheep-shearing feast. Autolycus dupes the clown by '
                 'pretending that he has been beaten, robbed, and then clothed '
                 'in his despicable rags. The clown is sorry for Autolycus and '
                 'offers him money. Then he hastens off to buy his supplies. '
                 "Autolycus chortles about lifting the clown's purse and "
                 'exits. The scene that follows focuses on the sheep-shearing '
                 'feast. Florizel and Perdita flounder in an awkward '
                 "courtship. Florizel praises Perdita's qualifications as the "
                 'chosen "queen" of this spring ritual. But aware of '
                 "Florizel's being a true prince, and the unreality of her "
                 'title as "queen," Perdita is unhappy. She cautions Florizel '
                 'about the potential wrath that a liaison between them might '
                 'arouse in his father. Florizel urges her to remember some of '
                 'the mythical transformations that love has caused. As '
                 'Perdita again urges the prince to be realistic, he swears to '
                 'honor his love for her above all other things. He then '
                 'commands her to exhibit cheer for her approaching "guests." '
                 'Perdita\'s "father," the shepherd, chides her for neglecting '
                 'her duties as a "queen." Therefore, Perdita begins '
                 'entertaining; first, she greets the disguised Polixenes and '
                 'Camillo and hands out flowers to them. After the king and '
                 "his adviser observe Perdita's prudent parries to Florizel's "
                 'bold courtship, Polixenes observes a bearing and beauty in '
                 'Perdita that transcend her supposedly low station. Camillo '
                 'affirms these unusual qualities. The clown moves the '
                 'festival into action by calling for music and dance, and '
                 "again, Polixenes remarks upon Perdita's grace. The shepherd "
                 'says that the young couple love each other and hints that '
                 '"Doricles" (Florizel\'s pseudonym) will discover an '
                 'unsuspected dowry if he proposes to Perdita. The '
                 'entertainment continues with a dance of twelve satyrs '
                 'performed by a group of uninvited amateurs, but throughout '
                 'these dances, Polixenes observes Florizel and Perdita. '
                 'Deciding that it is time to part the couple, the king calls '
                 'Florizel over to ask why he did not bring presents to '
                 'enliven his romance. The love-struck prince declares that '
                 'Perdita does not care for such trifles; she wants only gifts '
                 'that are locked in his heart. When Florizel declares that no '
                 "power or wealth could seem worthwhile without Perdita's "
                 'love, Polixenes and Camillo support the sentiment. The '
                 'shepherd then asks his daughter if she feels the same way. '
                 'She says that she does but cannot express it as well. The '
                 'shepherd declares the betrothal of the young couple, with '
                 'the two strangers as witnesses. The disguised Polixenes '
                 'urges Florizel to consult his father before making such an '
                 'important decision, but Florizel impetuously and repeatedly '
                 'refuses. Enraged, Polixenes casts off his disguise and '
                 'threatens to punish all who participated in the betrothal '
                 'without consulting him. Perdita sighs that she was afraid '
                 'something like this would happen. She urges Florizel to make '
                 'up with his father and never return to her. The shepherd, in '
                 'great confusion and despair, berates the young people for '
                 'the ruin and the wretched death that they have probably '
                 'condemned him to. But Florizel stubbornly clings to Perdita '
                 'and tells his father to go ahead and disinherit him. When '
                 'Florizel decides to take Perdita and flee in a ship anchored '
                 'nearby, Camillo stops him, advising him to make peace with '
                 'his father. Then Camillo begins laying a plot to try and '
                 'eventually return to Sicilia himself. Camillo convinces '
                 'Florizel to marry Perdita so he can present himself with his '
                 'new bride to Leontes in Sicilia. He predicts that Leontes '
                 'will welcome the opportunity to be the host for the son of '
                 'the long-separated "brother," since Polixenes will not '
                 "respond to Leontes' invitation to end their old quarrel. "
                 'Florizel agrees that this plan seems preferable to wandering '
                 'forever as unwelcome strangers in strange lands. Camillo '
                 'then offers funds from his wealth in Sicilia to properly '
                 'outfit the royal party. Act V is set again in Sicilia. '
                 'Leontes is seemingly much the same man as he was when we '
                 'last saw him sixteen years before. He is conversing with '
                 'Paulina and the two lords who brought the message from '
                 'Delphos, Cleomenes and Dion. Cleomenes is urging Leontes to '
                 'forget and forgive his evil "as the heavens have done." But '
                 'Leontes says that as long as he can remember those whom he '
                 'lost, especially Hermione, he cannot forget his errors. '
                 "Paulina, we see, is still feeding Leontes' guilt. Cleomenes "
                 'and Dion ask Paulina to "stop salting the wounds." She '
                 'retorts that their wish for the king to heal so that he can '
                 'marry again counters Apollo\'s oracle "that King Leontes '
                 'shall not have an heir/ Till his lost child be found," an '
                 'event as unlikely as the return of her own husband, '
                 'Antigonus. She tells Leontes not to wish for an heir. '
                 'Leontes encourages Paulina to continue to remind him of '
                 "Hermione's superior virtues; he believes that taking any "
                 'other wife would end in disaster. Paulina extracts an oath '
                 'from Leontes, in the presence of the two witnesses, that he '
                 'will not marry until Paulina approves. Paulina states that '
                 'such a time will come only when Hermione is recreated. A '
                 'servant enters then to announce the arrival of Prince '
                 'Florizel and his wife, whom he describes as a woman '
                 'unsurpassed in beauty and virtue. Leontes cleverly perceives '
                 "that Florizel's small group of attendants means that this "
                 'visit is "forced." It is not an official visit, at all. '
                 "Paulina notes the servant's excessive praise of Florizel's "
                 'wife. She chides him for such praise when he has written '
                 'verses that have stated that Hermione could never be '
                 'equaled. The servant, however, maintains that all will agree '
                 'with him after they have seen Perdita. Leontes is thrown '
                 'into a miserable reminiscence when he sees the young couple. '
                 'They remind him of his loss of friendship with Polixenes. '
                 'Florizel claims that his father sent him to reinstate that '
                 'old friendship; Polixenes, he says, is too infirm to make '
                 'the trip himself, and he then relates an imaginary tale '
                 'about his strange arrival. He says that he has arrived from '
                 'Libya, where he acquired Perdita. He explains the small '

                 'isolated existence of the Bolkonskys at their country seat. '
                 'Prince Andrey and Pierre discuss their futures and what they '

                 'who is soon to invade Russia. Old Count Bezuhov dies, '
                 'leaving Pierre wealthy, titled, and the most eligible '
                 'bachelor in Petersburg. Nikolay Rostov and Prince Andrey '
                 'undergo their first war experience at the battle of '
                 'Schöngraben. They each discover the ineffectuality of the '
                 'individual in a mass situation. Nikolay accepts being a"cog '
                 'in a machine" and Andrey rejects being part of the '
                 'administering forces, choosing, instead, to fight at the '
                 'front. Pierre marries Ellen; Anatole unsuccessfully courts '
                 'Marya. Andrey attends the war council on the eve of '
                 'Austerlitz and wishes to be a hero. He is wounded during the '
                 'battle. Compared to the limitless sky, which symbolizes '
                 'death, Napoleon seems to Andrey petty and insignificant. '
                 'Nikolay, with Denisov, is home on leave and he ignores his '
                 'sweetheart Sonya. Pierre wounds Dolohov in a duel over '
                 "Ellen's alleged infidelity. Liza Bolkonsky dies giving birth "
                 'to a son, leaving Andrey with a deep sense of unassuageable '
                 'guilt. Dolohov falls in love with Sonya and avenges her '
                 'rejection of him by fleecing Nikolay during a card '
                 'game."Intensity" is the keynote of this section, shown by '
                 'incidents of love and hate, life and death. Separated from '
                 'his wife, Pierre devotes himself to"goodness," by joining '
                 'the masons and by an inept reforming of his estates. He and '
                 'the retired Andrey have a discussion about the meaning of '
                 'life and death and Andrey is inspired with new hope. The '
                 'significance of their exchange points out the contrast '
                 'between Pierre and Andrey. Meanwhile Nikolay has rejoined '
                 'his starving regiment and Denisov faces court-martial for '
                 'stealing food for his men. Nikolay asks the tsar for '
                 "Denisov's pardon and witnesses the meeting between Napoleon "
                 'and Alexander, a meeting between the old and new orders of '
                 'government. His petition rejected, Nikolay decides the '
                 'sovereign knows best and submits to"higher authority." This '
                 'is an account of"real life," as opposed to politics, where '
                 'the"inner man" is more significant than the"outer man." '
                 "Andrey becomes involved with Speransky's circle of "
                 'reformers, but when he falls in love with Natasha these '
                 'activities pall for him. Pierre becomes disillusioned with '
                 'masonry, while Princess Marya is made more unhappy by her '
                 "father. The Rostovs' financial problems increase, and Andrey "
                 'goes to Switzerland. With the wolf hunt, the sleigh ride, '
                 'Christmas celebrations, and family harmony, the Rostovs '
                 'enjoy the last period of their"youth." Natasha\'s '
                 "restlessness increases during Andrey's absence, the family "
                 'is almost bankrupt, and there is foreboding of hard times to '
                 'come as the children enter adulthood. Natasha meets Anatole '
                 'during the opera and is almost abducted by him. During her '
                 'near-nervous breakdown, Pierre emerges as her comforter and '
                 'their love is implied. The life-and-death struggle against '
                 'France begins, with Napoleon depicted as a glory-seeking '
                 'fool. Andrey turns away from his past and commits himself to '
                 'the men in his regiment, who adore him. Nikolay refrains '
                 'from killing a Frenchman and is decorated for bravery '
                 'because he took a prisoner. Natasha slowly recovers, aided '
                 'by religious faith. Petya joins the army out of a youthful '
                 'patriotism which Pierre also shares. The Russians respond '
                 'massively to the national threat, and Pierre feels within '
                 'him an"ultimate mission" involving his love, the comet, '
                 'Napoleon, and the war itself. The French who are penetrating '
                 'Russia march toward their doom in the"irresistible tide" of '
                 'destiny. The old prince dies and Marya moves her household '
                 'to Moscow, but the war looms closer. Despite the national '
                 'upheaval, the Petersburg salons remain the same. Marya and '
                 'Nikolay have a romantic first meeting, while Pierre visits '
                 'the deathmarked Andrey on the eve of Borodino. The battle is '
                 'described as a death duel, with the Russians winning '
                 'morally, if not physically. This marks the turning point '
                 'from defeat to victory for Russia. Tolstoy discusses mass '
                 'activity as a combination of"infinitesimal units of '
                 'activity" and provides a short summary of past and future '
                 "events. Moscow's abandonment and burning is the great deed "
                 'that saves Russia and the moment-by-moment details of the '
                 "event are discussed, including Rastoptchin's last-minute bid "
                 'for glory at the expense of the cause he pretends to '
                 'further. The Rostovs leave Moscow, their caravan including '
                 'the mortally wounded Prince Andrey. He is reunited with '
                 'Natasha, who nurses him. So close to death, Andrey '
                 'understands the quality of divine love. Truth results from a '
                 'life-death confrontation. Pierre conceives the plan to '
                 'assassinate Napoleon, but other incidents show he is '
                 'destined to fail. Nikolay and Marya meet again in the '
                 'provinces, and Marya travels to see her brother. She and '
                 'Natasha are with him when he dies. Pierre is nearly executed '
                 'by the French, who accuse him of incendiarism. He '
                 'experiences a"rebirth" in prison through Karataev, an almost '
                 'mythic figure symbolizing the unity of love and hate, life '
                 'and death. The end of the war is in sight as the French '
                 'retreat more and more rapidly. Their retreat is the"fruit" '
                 'of"unconscious activity" rather than the will of Napoleon. '
                 'Pierre discovers an intense freedom in prison. This period '
                 'of guerilla fighting involves Denisov, Dolohov, and Petya, '
                 'who gets killed. A surprise attack led by Denisov and '
                 'Dolohov frees Pierre and other prisoners. In a flashback we '
                 'learn how Karataev died, and what Pierre suffered and '
                 'overcame during the death march. Death and decay are part of '
                 'the processes of life and growth. Natasha and Marya are '
                 'recalled from their mourning into active life: Marya by her '
                 'household responsibilities, Natasha by exercising love to '
                 'comfort her bereaved mother. As the war history is over, '
                 "Kutuzov's career ends. A new era begins to disclose itself "
                 "with Russia's entrance into international leadership. "
                 'Tolstoy apotheosizes Kutuzov. Pierre and Natasha meet again. '
                 'Tolstoy details the"happy ending" of the careers of his '
                 'fictional characters in scenes to show the domestic '
                 'happiness of Nikolay and Marya Rostov, Natasha and Pierre '
                 'Bezuhov. The cycle of life begins anew as Nikolinka, '
                 "Andrey's son, comes of age and desires to be like Pierre and "
                 'like his father. This is the philosophical exegesis wherein '
                 'Tolstoy shows that"free will" is a mere construct which '
                 'historians use to explain the movements of nations and '
                 'people. Causality is impossible to descry when we regard the '
                 'pattern of historical events, and the concept of"free will" '
                 'prevents deep understanding of the nature of history. The '
                 'paradox, however, is inescapable: We need to maintain the '
                 'illusion of free will in order to carry on our daily lives, '
                 'for our hopes, our basic beliefs depend on this notion of an '
                 'inner consciousness; at the same time we are victims of '
                 'innumerable and infinitesimal constraints of necessity which '
                 'spell out our destiny and we are not"free" at all.',

 'summary_text': 'Before the action of the play begins, the following events '
                 'are assumed to have taken place. Mirabell, a young '
                 'man-about-town, apparently not a man of great wealth, has '
                 'had an affair with Mrs. Fainall, the widowed daughter of '
                 'Lady Wishfort. To protect her from scandal in the event of '
                 'pregnancy, he has helped engineer her marriage to Mr. '
                 'Fainall, a man whom he feels to be of sufficiently good '
                 'reputation to constitute a respectable match, but not a man '
                 'of such virtue that tricking him would be unfair. Fainall, '
                 'for his part, married the young widow because he coveted her '
                 'fortune to support his amour with Mrs. Marwood. In time, the '
                 'liaison between Mirabell and Mrs. Fainall ended (although '
                 'this is not explicitly stated), and Mirabell found himself '
                 'in love with Millamant, the niece and ward of Lady '
                 'Wish-fort, and the cousin of his former mistress. There are, '
                 "however, financial complications. Half of Millamant's "
                 'fortune was under her own control, but the other half, 6,000 '
                 'pounds, was controlled by Lady Wishfort, to be turned over '
                 'to Millamant if she married a suitor approved by her aunt. '
                 'Unfortunately, Mirabell had earlier offended Lady Wishfort; '
                 'she had misinterpreted his flattery as love. Mirabell, '
                 'therefore, has contrived an elaborate scheme. He has '
                 'arranged for a pretended uncle (his valet, Waitwell) to woo '
                 'and win Lady Wishfort. Then Mirabell intends to reveal the '
                 'actual status of the successful wooer and obtain her consent '
                 'to his marriage to Millamant by rescuing her from this '
                 "misalliance. Waitwell was to marry Foible, Lady Wishfort's "
                 'maid, before the masquerade so that he might not decide to '
                 'hold Lady Wishfort to her contract; Mirabell is too much a '
                 'man of his time to trust anyone in matters of money or love. '
                 'Millamant is aware of the plot, probably through Foible. '
                 'When the play opens, Mirabell is impatiently waiting to hear '
                 "that Waitwell is married to Foible. During Mirabell's card "
                 'game with Fainall, it becomes clear that the relations '
                 'between the two men are strained. There are hints at the '
                 'fact that Fainall has been twice duped by Mirabell: Mrs. '
                 "Fainall is Mirabell's former mistress, and Mrs. Marwood, "
                 "Fainall's mistress, is in love with Mirabell. In the "
                 'meantime, although Millamant quite clearly intends to have '
                 'Mirabell, she enjoys teasing him in his state of '
                 'uncertainty. Mirabell bids fair to succeed until, '
                 'unfortunately, Mrs. Marwood overhears Mrs. Fainall and '
                 'Foible discussing the scheme, as well as Mirabell and Mrs. '
                 "Fainall's earlier love affair. Since Mrs. Marwood also "
                 'overhears insulting comments about herself, she is vengeful '
                 'and informs Fainall of the plot and the fact, which he '
                 "suspected before, that his wife was once Mirabell's "
                 'mistress. The two conspirators now have both motive and '
                 'means for revenge. In the same afternoon, Millamant accepts '
                 "Mirabell's proposal and rejects Sir Wilfull Witwoud, Lady "
                 "Wishfort's candidate for her hand. Fainall now dominates the "
                 'action. He unmasks Sir Rowland, the false uncle, and '
                 "blackmails Lady Wishfort with the threat of her daughter's "
                 "disgrace. He demands that the balance of Millamant's "
                 'fortune, now forfeit, be turned over to his sole control, as '
                 "well as the unspent balance of Mrs. Fainall's fortune. In "
                 'addition, he wants assurance that Lady Wishfort will not '
                 'marry so that Mrs. Fainall is certain to be the heir. This '
                 "move of Fainall's is now countered; Millamant says that she "
                 'will marry Sir Wilfull to save her own fortune. Fainall '
                 "insists that he wants control of the rest of his wife's "
                 "money and immediate management of Lady Wishfort's fortune. "
                 'When Mirabell brings two servants to prove that Fainall and '
                 'Mrs. Marwood were themselves guilty of adultery, Fainall '
                 'ignores the accusation and points out that he will still '
                 'create a scandal which would blacken the name of Mrs. '
                 'Fainall unless he gets the money. At this point, Mirabell '
                 'triumphantly reveals his most successful ploy. Before Mrs. '
                 'Fainall married Fainall, she and Mirabell had suspected the '
                 "man's character, and she had appointed her lover trustee of "
                 'her fortune. Fainall is left with no claim to make because '
                 'Mrs. Fainall does not control her own money. He and Mrs. '
                 'Marwood leave in great anger. Sir Wilfull steps aside as '
                 "Millamant's suitor; Lady Wishfort forgives the servants and "
                 'consents to the match of Mirabell and Millamant.',

                 'to be fed. Strangely, the next morning, there are only five '
                 'dogs to be fed. As a result, they become suspicious, and '
                 'finally they notice a she-wolf who comes to the camp at '
                 'night and lures the dogs away. When the men have only two '
                 'dogs left, Bill decides to shoot the she-wolf, but he is '
                 'killed himself by the famished wolf pack. Thus Henry is left '
                 'alone — with only two dogs and no ammunition — and after '
                 'days of traveling, covering only a short distance each day, '
                 'he is forced to build a fire to surround himself and protect '
                 'himself from the wolves. When he awakens in the morning, he '
                 'realizes immediately that his supply of wood is gone, and he '
                 'cannot go out and search for some more. He resigns himself, '
                 'therefore, to the inevitable, but he is finally rescued by a '
                 'group of men who are also out in the wild. Part Two of the '
                 'novel shifts the narrative perspective to that of the '
                 'she-wolf. After the famine is over, the wolf pack separates, '
                 'and the she-wolf and three males travel together, until one '
                 'of the wolves, "One Eye," kills the other two. The she-wolf '
                 'and One Eye travel together, then, until it is time for her '
                 'to settle down to give birth to her cubs. Another famine '
                 'comes upon the land when the cubs are still young, and all '
                 'of the cubs die — except one: a gray wolf cub. This gray '
                 'wolf is the strongest and the most adventuresome of all the '
                 'litter. Yet early in his life, he learns how to snare food '
                 'and along with this ability, he learns the lesson of the '
                 'wilderness — that is, "eat or be eaten, kill or be killed." '
                 'In Part Three, the cub and its mother wander into an Indian '
                 'camp, where the mother is recognized by an Indian named Gray '
                 'Beaver; she answers immediately to the call of "Kiche," and '
                 'the little gray cub is promptly named White Fang. In the '
                 'Indian camp, the cub has to learn how to function in the '
                 'presence of the Indians, and he must also learn how to '
                 'protect himself against the other puppies. When his mother '
                 'is taken from him, he attempts to follow her, but he is '
                 'severely beaten by Gray Beaver, and thus he quickly learns '
                 'another lesson — to obey the "man-god." When Gray Beaver '
                 'goes to the nearest fort to sell his furs, he takes White '
                 'Fang with him. There at the fort, White Fang becomes famous '
                 'for his ferocious ability to kill other dogs, and he is '
                 'sought after by a vicious, ugly man named, ironically, '
                 'Beauty Smith, who, by using trickery and alcohol, is able to '
                 'trick Gray Beaver into selling White Fang to him. White Fang '
                 'is treated terribly by this cruel man; he is constantly '
                 'forced into bloody fights with other dogs so that Smith can '
                 'win bets. But during one fight with a bulldog, White Fang is '
                 'at the point of being killed when a man named Weedon Scott, '
                 'a person of distinction and authority, interferes and stops '
                 'the fight. Furthermore, Scott pays off Beauty Smith and '
                 'threatens to have him jailed. Scott then takes White Fang '
                 'with him. Under the protection and patience and compassion '
                 'of Weedon Scott, White Fang gradually learns to appreciate a '
                 'human being, and ultimately he comes to possess a love and '
                 'affection for Scott. When Weeden Scott has to return to his '
                 'home in the Southland (California), he at first intends to '
                 'leave White Fang behind. White Fang, however, escapes and '
                 'sneaks aboard the ship. Scott, therefore, chooses to take '
                 'the dog along. The novel ends by showing how White Fang '
                 'learns to exist as a domesticated animal. Ultimately, White '
                 "Fang wins the affection of Scott's family because of his "
                 'extreme intelligence (for example, he leads some men to help '
                 'his injured master) and also because of his performing an '
                 'act of bravery by risking his life to save Judge Scott from '
                 'being murdered.',

                 'following. Ida, a young Indian girl raised on a Montana '
                 "reservation, faces a crisis in her and her family's life "
                 "when Clara, her mother's sister and therefore Ida's aunt, "

                 "to accept Clara and Lecon's child as her own. When the "
                 'child, who is named Christine, is born, Ida assumes full '
                 'responsibility for raising it. She even gets a legal decree '
                 'declaring that Christine is legally hers. Four years after '

                 'whom she names Lee. Christine and Lee have a very close '
                 'sister-brother relationship, each relying on the other for '
                 'emotional support. However, as young adults, Christine '
                 'emotionally blackmails Lee into enlisting in the military '
                 "during the Vietnam War; Lee's best friend and Christine's "
                 "rival for Lee's attention, Dayton, opposes Lee's enlistment. "
                 "Christine moves from Ida's house and the reservation to "
                 "Seattle, moving from one menial job to another. She's "
                 'devastated when she gets a letter from Dayton saying that '
                 'Lee is missing in action. To console herself, she goes to a '
                 'bar, where she meets a black soldier named Elgin. The two '
                 'instantly hit it off and move in together, although Elgin is '
                 'away from home because of his on-base military duties. When '
                 'Elgin is released from the military, he and Christine begin '

                 'However, Christine gets pregnant, she and Elgin get married, '
                 'and then Elgin begins staying out late after work and '
                 "oftentimes not even coming home at night. He's having an "

                 'She and Ida, who has always demanded that her children call '

                 'accept her for who she is, without asking any questions. But '
                 "Evelyn and Sky eventually learn of Rayona's past and about "

                 'Rayona steels herself and rides a bucking bronco, which '

                 'Rayona one of her favorite rings. Also, although not stated '

                 'When the children don’t follow her rules, she comes up with '

                 'it to be as magical as he had hoped. While the rest of the '
                 'aunt’s house is largely unexciting, the lumber room is '
                 'filled with fascinating curiosities like a tapestry '
                 'depicting a hunting scene in which a man has shot an arrow '
                 'into a stag but is unaware of four approaching wolves. '
                 'Nicholas loses himself in the story the tapestry depicts, '
                 'wondering whether the man and his two dogs will be able to '
                 'escape the wolves, and if there are perhaps more than four '
                 'wolves. He also finds many other thrilling objects in the '
                 'lumber room, like candlesticks shaped like twisted snakes, '
                 'and a teapot shaped like a duck. Suddenly, Nicholas hears '
                 'his aunt calling his name, asking him to come out of the '
                 'gooseberry garden because she can see him there. Nicholas '
                 'smiles to himself, because he knows she is lying. Soon '
                 'after, he hears his aunt scream and call for someone to '
                 'hurry to her. Nicholas locks up the lumber room and goes to '
                 'the front garden to investigate. His aunt calls to him from '
                 'the gooseberry garden and says that she has fallen into the '
                 'rain-water tank. She asks him to bring her a ladder so she '
                 'can climb out, but Nicholas responds by saying that he was '
                 'told to stay out of the gooseberry garden. The aunt hastily '
                 'tells him that she has changed her mind and that he can now '
                 'enter it. To this, Nicholas replies that she doesn’t sound '
                 'like his aunt, and that he suspects the “Evil One” is in the '
                 'water tank, not his aunt. He asks if there will be '
                 'strawberry jam for tea, and when the aunt says there will '
                 'be, Nicholas triumphantly declares that this is evidence '
                 'that it is indeed the Evil One in the water tank pretending '
                 'to be his aunt. When the children had asked the aunt for '
                 'strawberry jam the previous day, she’d said there wasn’t '
                 'any. So clearly, Nicholas says, she couldn’t have known '
                 'there were four jars of it in the store cupboard. Nicholas '
                 'had looked, so he knew, and the Evil One in the water tank '
                 'knew, but the aunt didn’t know. The Evil One has given '
                 'himself away, Nicholas says, and walks away without helping '
                 'the aunt out of the water tank. She is finally rescued 35 '
                 'minutes later by a kitchen maid. Later that day, teatime is '
                 'quiet. The aunt is upset after being stuck in the water '
                 'tank. The children did not enjoy their trip to Jagborough '
                 'because the tide was high and no one got to play in the '
                 'sand, and Bobby is in a bad mood because of his tight boots. '
                 'Nicholas is quiet, too, imagining a conclusion to the story '
                 'on the tapestry, wondering if the hunter and his dogs would '
                 'manage to escape if they left the stag to the wolves.',

 'summary_text': 'In Paris in 1640, a large, boisterous group of city-dwellers '
                 'attends a bawdy play. At the play is a young, handsome Baron '
                 'named Christian de Neuvillette . Lately, Christian has '
                 'become enamored with a beautiful young woman. That night, he '
                 'learns from a local drunk, Ligniere , that the woman’s name '
                 'is Roxane . Ligniere explains that Roxane is being pursued '
                 'by the young, haughty Viscount de Valvert . Valvert is '
                 'acting on the behalf of the powerful Count de Guiche , a man '
                 'who’s clearly attracted to Roxane, but who already has a '
                 'fiancée. As the play begins, a stranger shouts, “Stop!” and '
                 'jumps onto the stage. The man, Cyrano de Bergerac , who has '
                 'an enormous nose , explains that he has banned the play’s '
                 'principle actor, Montfluery , from ever appearing in a play '
                 'again. Members of the audience complain that Cyrano is '
                 'ruining the play, but they fall silent when Cyrano draws his '
                 'sword. Cyrano’s close friends, Le Bret and Ragueneau , '
                 'explain that Cyrano is a talented, clever gentleman, and '
                 'warn their peers not to make fun of Cyrano’s nose. Valvert '
                 'makes jokes about Cyrano’s nose, and in response, Cyrano '
                 'challenges Valvert to a duel. During the duel, Cyrano amazes '
                 'the spectators of the play by composing an elaborate, '
                 'insulting poem about Valvert on the spot, and he defeats '
                 'Valvert just as he finishes his rhyme. Cyrano, who serves as '
                 'a soldier in the military, learns that Ligniere will be '
                 'attacked by a vast army of 100 men that night. Cyrano also '
                 'tells Le Bret and Ragueneau that he’s in love with his '
                 'cousin, who’s revealed to be Roxane. Cyrano is afraid to '
                 'confess his feelings, because although he’s brilliant and '
                 'eloquent, he thinks that his ugly face will surely disgust '
                 'Roxane. That night, Cyrano receives word that Roxane wants '
                 'to meet with him the next morning. Excited, Cyrano bravely '
                 'volunteers to defend Ligniere from his enemies that night. '
                 'The next morning, Cyrano goes Ragueneau’s pastry shop, where '
                 'he’s to meet with Roxane. The previous night, he’s '
                 'successfully defended Ligniere from 100 soldiers, inspired '
                 'by his love for Roxane. Roxane arrives at the pastry shop '
                 'and tells Cyrano that she has a secret to confess: she’s in '
                 'love with one of Cyrano’s fellow soldiers in the army: '
                 'Christian. Cyrano is visibly disappointed by this news, but '
                 'he agrees to protect Christian from danger and find out if '
                 'Christian loves Roxane in return. After Roxane leaves, the '
                 'Count de Guiche enters the pastry shop. Although he greets '
                 'Cyrano as a friend, Cyrano broodingly ignores de Guiche, '
                 'deeply offending the Count. Cyrano’s fellow cadets crowd the '
                 'pastry shop, eager to hear about Cyrano’s fight the previous '
                 'night. Cyrano notices Christian among the soldiers. '
                 'Christian, who’s new to the army, tries to prove his bravery '
                 'by insulting Cyrano’s nose. Furious but unable to take his '
                 'revenge on Christian, Cyrano asks Christian if he loves '
                 'Roxane. Christian replies that he does, but admits that he '
                 'lacks the verbal skills necessary to woo Roxane. Cyrano '
                 'produces a love letter (which, unbeknownst to Christian, '
                 'he’s written for Roxane) and tells Christian to give it to '
                 'Roxane in his own name. Christian gratefully accepts the '
                 'letter, not realizing that Cyrano loves Roxane. Together, '
                 'Cyrano and Christian plan to seduce Roxane, with Christian '
                 'serving as the “face” of the operation and Cyrano supplying '
                 'the eloquent words. A few weeks later, Christian has '
                 'successfully wooed Roxane, sending her letters composed by '
                 'Cyrano. The time has come for Christian to meet Roxane '
                 'face-to-face. When Christian first speaks to Roxane, he’s so '
                 'tongue-tied that Roxane is deeply disappointed—because of '
                 'Cyrano’s letters, she’d been expecting a genius. Humiliated, '
                 'Christian runs away. Next, Roxane crosses paths with the '
                 'Count de Guiche, who’s still madly in love with her. De '
                 'Guiche begs Roxane for the chance to see her later that '
                 'night—he explains that he’s being shipped out to fight in '
                 'Arras soon. Knowing that if de Guiche is sent to fight, '
                 'Christian and the other soldiers will have to go with him, '
                 'Roxane tells de Guiche to see her later that night. Later in '
                 'the night, Christian and Cyrano go to Roxane’s house to woo '
                 'her. Roxane, standing at her window, is at first reluctant '
                 'to speak any further to Christian. But Cyrano, imitating '
                 'Christian’s voice, succeeds in impressing her, with Roxane '
                 'unaware that the man she’s listening to is her cousin, not '
                 'Christian. Roxane is so overcome with love for “Christian” '
                 'that she tells him to come into her house so that they can '
                 'embrace one another. Meanwhile, a Monk walks to Roxane’s '
                 'house on behalf of Count de Guiche. Roxane cleverly tricks '
                 'the Monk into marrying her to Christian on the spot. By the '
                 'time the Count arrives at Roxane’s home, she’s married to '
                 'Christian. Furious, de Guiche vows to have Cyrano and '
                 'Christian shipped to the front lines in the Siege of Arras. '
                 'Before Cyrano and Christian are shipped off to fight, Roxane '
                 'makes Cyrano promise to make sure Christian writes to her '
                 'often. At the Siege of Arras, there is a horrible famine, '
                 'and Christian senses that he’s starving. Cyrano writes long, '
                 'romantic letters to Roxane, always signing them with '
                 'Christian’s name. One day, the Count de Guiche arrives at '
                 'the soldiers’ camp and announces that a battle is about to '
                 'take place. Suddenly, Roxane arrives at the camp. She '
                 'explains that she’s become so overcome with love for '
                 'Christian—thanks to Cyrano’s letters—that she felt compelled '
                 'to come see him. Roxane explains that she’s fallen in love '
                 'with “Christian’s” eloquence and wit—at this point, she '
                 'doesn’t care what he looks like. Christian secretly finds '
                 'this disturbing, since it means that Roxane is actually in '
                 'love with Cyrano. As the battle is about to begin, Cyrano '
                 'gives Christian one last letter to give Roxane, in case he’s '
                 'killed. Christian begins to realize the truth: Cyrano loves '
                 'Roxane just as much as he does. Christian insists that '
                 'Cyrano must tell Roxane the truth. Just as Cyrano is about '
                 'to admit his feelings to Roxane, though, there’s a shot: '
                 'Christian falls dead, the first casualty of the battle. '
                 'Cyrano realizes that he can never tell Roxane how he feels. '
                 'After Christian’s death, Roxane goes to live in a convent '
                 'and mourn her dead husband. Fifteen years later, Cyrano has '
                 'become a lonely, unpopular man. His aggressive manner and '
                 'penchant for fighting has made him dozens of enemies. Every '
                 'week, he goes to visit Roxane at her convent, but he never '
                 'admits that he loves her. One day, de Guiche—now a powerful '
                 'Duke—comes to visit Roxane at her convent. He warns Le Bret '
                 'and Ragueneau, Cyrano’s last remaining friends, that someone '
                 'is about to ambush Cyrano by dropping a heavy weight on his '
                 'head, and they run off to alert him. Shortly afterward, '
                 'Cyrano shows up at the convent, his hat pulled low over his '
                 'head. Cyrano and Roxane talk about their lives, and '
                 'reminisce about Christian. Roxane produces the letter '
                 'Christian wrote her, and Cyrano begins quoting the letter '
                 'from memory. Roxane realizes that Cyrano was the one who '
                 'wrote Christian’s letters. Suddenly, Le Bret and Ragueneau '
                 'rush back—they were too late. Cyrano takes off his hat, '
                 'revealing a heavy bandage: he’s already been attacked, and '
                 'is slowly dying of his wounds. Tearfully, Roxane, Ragueneau, '
                 'and Le Bret rest Cyrano on the ground. Moments from death, '
                 'Cyrano tells Roxane that he’s always loved her. Roxane, '
                 'weeping, tells Cyrano that she’ll always remember him, just '
                 'as she’s remembered Christian ever since his death. With his '
                 'final breaths, Cyrano claims that there’s one thing he’ll '
                 'take with him to heaven when he dies: his “panache.”',

{'author': 'The Awakening',
 'book_title': 'The Awakening',
 'source': 'litcharts',
 'summary_text': 'The story begins at Grand Isle, a ritzy vacation spot near '
                 'New Orleans, where Edna Pontellier is summering with her '
                 'husband and two children. Her husband Léonce is often away '
                 'on business, so she spends most of her time with a '
                 'beautiful, shallow friend named Adèle Ratignolle and a '
                 'charming young man named Robert Lebrun . From the beginning, '
                 'the reader perceives that all is not harmonious in the '
                 'Pontellier family: Edna seems bored by her children and '
                 'frustrated with Léonce, who is silly, ill-tempered, and '
                 'inattentive (his lavish gifts notwithstanding). Her '
                 'friendship with Robert, though, has been blossoming. They '
                 'spend almost every day in each other’s company, strolling on '
                 'the beach and exchanging quiet jokes and observations. The '
                 'third-person narrator, whose voice blends somewhat with '
                 'Edna’s inner voice, begins to remark on the artificiality of '
                 'the other women and to question Edna’s habitual obedience to '
                 'her foolish husband. One night, Edna is moved to tears at a '
                 'party by the music of Mademoiselle Reisz , a sharp-voiced '
                 'unmarried woman who most people dislike. Later that same '
                 'night, Edna conquers her fear of the sea and swims far into '
                 'the ocean. That night is the culmination of her awakening, '
                 'her critical, thoughtful examination of the social world and '
                 'of her inner life. Her friendship with Robert becomes '
                 'romantically charged. Soon, Robert leaves Grand Isle for '
                 'Mexico, where he hopes to forget the illicit romance. Edna '
                 'spends the rest of the summer longing for his company. In '
                 'September the Pontelliers return to New Orleans. Edna begins '
                 'to neglect her household and her children so that she can '
                 'devote her days to painting, reading, and seeing friends. '
                 'Her friendship with Madame Ratignolle disintegrates '
                 'somewhat, but she goes often to see Mademoiselle Reisz, who '
                 'gives Edna good advice, shows her Robert’s letters (which '
                 'mention his love for her), and plays beautiful pieces on the '
                 'piano. Edna’s concerned husband consults with Doctor '
                 'Mandelet , a wise family friend, who advises him to wait it '
                 'out. Edna also becomes romantically involved with Arobin , a '
                 'fashionable young man with a bad reputation. She doesn’t '
                 'love him, but she is strongly physically attracted to him. '
                 'Their relationship is a source of confusion and anxiety to '
                 'her. Edna’s husband leaves for a long business trip and her '
                 'children go to stay with their grandmother. She loves her '
                 'new freedom and decides to move to a smaller house, moving '
                 'out of her current home and leaving her husband. By selling '
                 'her paintings, she can become financially independent. She '
                 'throws a beautiful going-away party, but is troubled '
                 'throughout by feelings of blankness and despair. One day, '
                 'Edna learns from Mademoiselle Reisz that Robert is due back '
                 'in New Orleans. She runs into him at the pianist’s apartment '
                 'a few days later. He is distant and formal at first, but she '
                 'convinces him to have dinner at her new house, and soon '
                 'enough they begin to talk frankly and affectionately. He '
                 'stays away from her for some time, in a last effort to avoid '
                 'the affair, but when they run into each other again they '
                 'return to Edna’s house and confess their feelings openly. '
                 'They’re interrupted, however, by an urgent summons from '

{'author': 'The Village Schoolmaster',
 'book_title': 'The Village Schoolmaster',
 'source': 'litcharts',
 'summary_text': 'Several years before the beginning of this story, the '
                 'narrator says, a giant mole appeared in a remote provincial '
                 'village. The mole briefly attracted the attention of some '
                 'locals at the time, and even some visitors from the '
                 'surrounding area, but most people soon lost interest. The '
                 'one man who did not was the elderly schoolmaster of the '
                 'village, who took it upon himself to prove the mole’s '
                 'existence to the wider scientific community. He published '
                 'pamphlets and met with a scholar to drum up awareness of the '
                 'mole, but his efforts were routinely ignored or derided. '
                 'Meanwhile, the narrator, living in a nearby city, has heard '
                 'of the schoolmaster’s struggle and takes pity on him. He '
                 'finds the schoolmaster’s rejection by the scholarly '
                 'community to be unfair and makes it his mission to help the '
                 'schoolmaster’s cause. The first step, the narrator decides, '
                 'is to publish a pamphlet of his own that will defend the '
                 'schoolmaster’s credibility. But the only attention the '
                 'narrator seems to arouse is that of the schoolmaster, who '
                 'becomes distracted by the appearance of an intervener in the '
                 'mole episode and starts to grow suspicious of the narrator’s '
                 'intentions—believing that the narrator wants to take credit '
                 'for the mole’s discovery. The schoolmaster’s jealousy '
                 'deepens over the years, even as the men end up meeting each '
                 'other on several occasions and trying to collaborate. '
                 'Instead of collaborating, however, the schoolmaster spends '
                 'his time complaining about the lack of public interest in '
                 'the mole and blaming the narrator for his failed efforts to '
                 'help. Simultaneously, the narrator describes the slow shift '
                 'in his own interests: from a philanthropic urge to support '
                 'the helpless teacher, toward an interest in the actual mole '
                 'itself. He starts investigating the original appearance of '
                 'the mole—interviewing witnesses and gathering so-called '
                 '“evidence.” This shift in the narrator’s interest is viewed '
                 'by the schoolmaster as a transgression on his territory. The '
                 'schoolmaster’s jealousy deepens and his accusations grow '
                 'more personal. As an undisclosed number of years and '
                 'pamphlets go by, the public still proves uninterested in the '
                 'mole. The narrator reaches his breaking point when a jeer at '
                 'the men’s efforts appears in the obscure back pages of an '
                 'agricultural journal. The narrator decides to wash his hands '
                 'of the affair and tries to recall all the copies of his '
                 'pamphlet he had sent to various scholars. Just as the copies '
                 'start to arrive, the schoolmaster comes to visit him in town '
                 'over Christmas. Immediately, the schoolmaster launches into '
                 'a diatribe on the agricultural journal’s notice, and an '
                 'argument erupts between the two men. In this argument, the '
                 'men reveal the motives that have pushed them all along. The '
                 'schoolmaster describes, in minute detail, the great fame and '
                 'fortune that he hoped to achieve from his scientific '
                 'discovery. The narrator, incredulous at the schoolmaster’s '
                 'delusion, tries to talk some sense into him by positing a '
                 'more realistic hypothetical outcome: the schoolmaster might '
                 'have been recognized locally, but his discovery would have '
                 'been absorbed into the broader scientific community and '
                 'would cease to belong to him. In describing this possible '
                 'outcome, the narrator reveals that his own motives for '
                 'becoming involved with the mole episode—while once thought '
                 'to be philanthropic in nature—have actually been unclear to '
                 'him all along. The men conclude at a standoff; though the '
                 'narrator plans to turn out the schoolmaster then and there, '
                 'he cannot bring himself to do so.',

 'source': 'shmoop',
 'summary_text': "Grab your life vests, Shmoopers—there's a monster out there. "
                 'A mysterious beast is attacking ships the world over. The '
                 'famous oceanographer, Pierre Aronnax, thinks that the beast '
                 'is a gargantuan narwhale. You know, a marine animal with a '
                 'freaking sword on its head . No big deal. So, Aronnax is '
                 'invited on a special mission by the U.S. Secretary of the '
                 'Navy to board the USS Abraham Lincoln and begin hunting for '
                 'this sea creature. After weeks of searching, the ship '
                 "finally encounters the beast, but it's simply no match for "
                 'it. Aronnax is thrown overboard when the monster rams the '
                 'ship, which leads his servant Conseil to go in after him. '
                 'The two struggle to get back onboard the Lincoln , only to '
                 'end up on the deck of some other vessel. All is not well on '
                 'the new ship. A bunch of men throw Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned '
                 'Land, a Canadian harpooner, into a cell below deck. Soon '
                 "after, they are visited by their crazy cap'n, who reveals "
                 'that he can speak all of the languages that they '
                 'speak—French, German, English, and Latin—even though he '
                 'pretended not to at first. Weirdo. So we know very little '
                 'about this guy who calls himself Captain Nemo, but he says '
                 'already knows who Aronnax and his men are… which is super '
                 'creepy, considering this whole story takes place in those '
                 'pre-Facebook days. How did he know?! Anyway, Nemo tells the '
                 'guys that he has "broken with humanity" and lives a secret '
                 "life under the sea. Spiffy, huh? Not really. Nemo's break "
                 'with normal people means that our three main dudes can never '
                 "go back on land. Nemo says they'll have freedom onboard his "
                 'vessel, the Nautilus , except for the fact that he might '
                 "lock them up again at any time… which doesn't sound much "
                 'like freedom to us. Nemo then announces that he will be '
                 'taking the Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned on a voyage through all '
                 "the world's seas. And boy do they voyage . They hunt in the "
                 'underwater forests of Crespo Island and visit Vanikoro, the '
                 'site of two famous shipwrecks. One of their expeditions gets '
                 'interrupted by cannibals. They travel through the Indian '
                 'Ocean and visit a bed of pearls, where Nemo saves a pearl '
                 'diver from a shark, and then has to be saved himself—by Ned. '
                 'Next, the crew visits some wrecked Spanish galleons carrying '
                 'tons of gold, where Nemo solves his cash flow problems. Nemo '
                 'even takes Aronnax on an expedition to see the lost city of '
                 'Atlantis before setting a course for the South Pole. After '
                 'some struggling, Nemo miraculously manages to plant his own '
                 'flag on the Pole. (Sort of like what Neil Armstrong and Buzz '
                 'Aldrin would later do on the moon .) And adventure, '
                 'adventure, adventure, blah, blah, blah. Finally, while '
                 'sailing north of England, Nemo himself becomes the target of '
                 "revenge; he's attacked by an unknown ship. Aronnax is "
                 'horrified when Nemo sinks this ship in order to get back at '
                 'those people who Nemo says took away his family and his '
                 'country. Lastly, the Nautilus drifts aimlessly until it '
                 "encounters… dun dun dun… the Maelstrom. Don't worry, it's "
                 'just a gigantic deadly vortex of water. As the Nautilus is '
                 'being pulled into this vortex, Aronnax, Ned, and Conseil '
                 'manage to jump ship. They wake up in a cabin on a remote '
                 'Norwegian island. There, our first-person narrator Aronnax '
                 'finishes recounting his wild and wacky voyage. But he hardly '
                 'answers all of our questions. Or even most of them. He still '
                 "doesn't know Nemo's home country or general backstory—or if "
                 'he even survived the Maelstrom. But, in trying to look on '
                 'the bright side of life , Aronnax hopes that Nemo survived. '
                 'And if Nemo did survive, he hopes that Nemo will be a '
                 'changed man. Aronnax likes to imagine that Nemo will leave '
                 'behind his vengeful ways and, you know, smile more.',

 'summary_text': 'One rainy night in Covent Garden, London, a crowd of people '
                 'from various social classes all seek shelter under the same '
                 'church portico. A wealthy mother (later revealed to be Mrs. '
                 'Eynsford Hill ) waits exasperatedly with her daughter Clara '
                 'for her son Freddy to find a taxi. Freddy enters, unable to '
                 'find one, but his mother sends him back out into the rain to '
                 'look again. Under the portico, a poor flower-girl ( Eliza '
                 'Doolittle ) sells a flower to a gentleman ( Colonel '
                 'Pickering ). A bystander tells Eliza to watch out for a '
                 'strange man in the back of the crowd taking notes. Eliza '
                 'thinks that the man is a policeman and that she is in '
                 'trouble. The man, who turns out to be Henry Higgins , steps '
                 'forward and guesses where everyone is from based on their '
                 'manner of speech. Everyone is confused and annoyed by the '
                 'meddlesome Higgins. Eliza thinks he is a policeman trying to '
                 'get her in trouble and insists that she is "a good girl." '
                 'Pickering asks Higgins how he can tell where everyone is '
                 'from, and Higgins explains that he studies phonetics and '
                 'teaches people how to speak in different accents. He says '
                 'that he could teach the flower-girl Eliza to speak so well '
                 'in just three months that she could pass for a noble lady. '
                 'Higgins and Pickering introduce themselves to each other, '
                 "realizing that they are familiar with each other's work "
                 '(Pickering is also a linguist). The rain stops and the crowd '
                 'under the portico disperses. Higgins and Pickering leave to '
                 'get dinner together, while Clara and her mother walk to a '
                 'bus. Freddy finally returns with a cab, only to find that '
                 "his family is no longer there. The next morning, in Higgins' "
                 '"laboratory" at his home, Higgins is showing all of his '
                 'scientific instruments and tools for recording and studying '
                 'speech to Pickering. Eliza arrives and offers to pay Higgins '
                 'for speaking lessons, so that she can learn to "talk more '
                 'genteel," and get a better job. Higgins doesn\'t think she '
                 'can afford to pay him, and scoffs rudely at her. Pickering '
                 "steps in and bets Higgins that he can't teach Eliza to speak "
                 "so well that she passes as a wealthy lady at an ambassador's "
                 'garden party in six months. He offers to pay for her '
                 'lessons. Higgins likes the idea and tells his housekeeper '
                 'Mrs. Pearce to wash Eliza and dress her in new clothes, '
                 'though Eliza protests. Eliza refuses to participate in the '
                 'bet, and Mrs. Pearce tells Higgins not to "walk over" Eliza. '
                 "Higgins neglects Eliza's feelings, ordering her to live with "
                 'him for six months and take speaking lessons. Mrs. Pearce '
                 'takes Eliza away to talk to her in private. Meanwhile, '
                 "Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle , comes to Higgins' house. "
                 "He says that he hasn't seen his daughter in months, but "
                 'learned of her whereabouts from the taxi driver who brought '
                 'her to the house. He asks Higgins for five pounds in return '
                 'for letting Eliza stay with him. Higgins and Pickering are '
                 'scandalized by Mr. Doolittle\'s willingness to "sell" his '
                 'daughter, but Higgins eventually agrees to give him money. '
                 'As Mr. Doolittle leaves, he runs into Eliza, who has washed '
                 'and changed into new clothes. Mr. Doolittle calls her "miss" '
                 'before recognizing her, getting into a fight with her, and '
                 'leaving. Mrs. Pearce enters and tells Eliza that she has '
                 'more clothes for her to try on. Eliza leaves eagerly, having '
                 'seemingly accepted the offer to stay with Higgins. It is a '
                 "few months later, at the home of Henry Higgins' mother, Mrs. "
                 'Higgins . Mrs. Higgins is ready to have some friends over '
                 'and is annoyed when Higgins barges in. Higgins tells her '
                 'about Eliza and says that he wants Eliza to sit with Mrs. '
                 'Higgins and her friends and try to act like a lady. Before '
                 "Higgins leaves, some of Mrs. Higgins' friends arrive: the "
                 "Eynsford Hills. Higgins at first doesn't recognize them from "
                 'the portico in Covent Garden. Eliza arrives, and the '
                 "Eynsford Hills don't recognize her as the flower-girl. "
                 'Everyone starts to make small talk about the weather, but '
                 'Eliza makes the mistake of talking about the death of her '
                 "aunt (in which she suspects foul play) and her father's "
                 'drinking habit. Freddy seems amused by Eliza, though Mrs. '
                 'Eynsford Hill is shocked by her conversation. After Eliza '
                 "leaves, Clara tells her mother that Eliza's speech is a new, "
                 'fashionable form of small talk. Clara says that manners are '
                 'only a matter of habit, so there are no right or wrong ones. '
                 'As the Eynsford Hills leave, Freddy says that he would like '
                 'to meet Eliza again sometime. Higgins asks his mother '
                 'whether Eliza was presentable, and she says that Eliza was '
                 'not. She tells Higgins there is no hope for Eliza to pass as '
                 'a lady. Mrs. Higgins then cautions her son about treating '
                 'Eliza like a "live doll," but Pickering assures her that '
                 'they take Eliza seriously. Higgins refers to Eliza as merely '
                 'an experiment. Mrs. Higgins worries about what will happen '
                 'to Eliza when the "experiment" is over. Several months '
                 "later, Eliza, Higgins, and Pickering return to Higgins' "
                 'house at midnight, after a long day and night. They have '
                 'gone to a garden party, followed by a dinner party, followed '
                 'by the opera. Eliza successfully passed as a wealthy lady, '
                 'and Higgins has won his bet. Higgins says he was not '
                 "surprised by Eliza's success and has in fact long been bored "
                 'with the wager. He thanks God that the experiment is over. '
                 'Eliza is offended at how the two men are speaking of her and '
                 "throws Higgins' slippers at him, calling him selfish and "
                 'inconsiderate. Higgins thinks she is ungrateful. Eliza '
                 'regains her composure and worries about what will happen to '
                 'her now. Higgins suggests she marry someone wealthy, to '
                 'ensure a comfortable life, but Eliza thinks of this as a '
                 'kind of prostitution and rejects the idea. Higgins says '
                 "Pickering can get her a job in a nice florist's shop. Eliza "
                 'asks whether her clothes belong to her now, because she '
                 "doesn't want to be accused of stealing them. Higgins is "
                 'offended by the question and tells Eliza she has wounded him '
                 '"to the heart." The next day, Mrs. Higgins is sitting in her '
                 'drawing room, when her parlor-maid tells her that Higgins '
                 'and Pickering are downstairs calling the police. Mrs. '
                 'Higgins tells the maid to go upstairs and inform Eliza, but '
                 'not to have her come down. Higgins comes into the room and '
                 'tells his mother that Eliza has run away. Mrs. Higgins tells '
                 'him that Eliza has the right to leave his house whenever she '
                 'wishes. Pickering enters and says that he has spoken with '
                 'the police about Eliza. The maid announces that a gentleman '
                 "named Mr. Doolittle is at the door. Higgins doesn't think "
                 "that this can be Eliza's father, but it turns out to be him, "
                 'dressed as a gentleman. Mr. Doolittle is upset because '
                 'Higgins has mentioned his name to a wealthy American named '
                 'Ezra Wannafeller , who has founded Moral Reform Societies '
                 'across the world. Higgins joked to Wannafeller that Mr. '
                 'Doolittle was England\'s "most original moralist," and '
                 'Wannafeller left Doolittle money in his will. Mr. Doolittle '
                 'is angry at having been turned into a somewhat wealthy '
                 'gentleman. He says his new money has brought him nothing but '
                 'worries and problems and tells Higgins that now he needs to '
                 'be taught how to speak proper English. Mrs. Higgins tells '
                 'Mr. Doolittle that he can care for Eliza now, but Higgins '
                 'wants to keep Eliza at his house. Mrs. Higgins scolds '
                 'Higgins and Pickering for how they have treated Eliza and '
                 'reveals that Eliza is actually upstairs. Mrs. Higgins calls '
                 'Eliza down. She is very polite to Pickering and Higgins. '
                 'Pickering is nice to Eliza, but Higgins is angry and rude to '
                 'her, ordering her to come back to his house. Eliza thanks '
                 'Pickering for teaching her good manners by example, and '
                 'tells him that her transformation was really spurred on by '
                 'when he called her Miss Doolittle once. Eliza says that she '
                 'has completely forgotten her old ways of speaking and '
                 'behaving. Higgins, though, thinks that she will return to '
                 'her lower-class habits within weeks. Eliza finally sees her '
                 'father and is shocked to hear that he is going to marry her '
                 'stepmother. He asks Eliza to come to his wedding. Mrs. '
                 'Higgins, Eliza, and Pickering all prepare to go to the '
                 'wedding. Higgins and Eliza are left alone in the room. Eliza '
                 'says that Higgins only wants her back to do chores and '
                 'errands for him. Higgins says that he cannot change his rude '
                 'manners toward her, because he cannot change his nature. He '
                 'explains that he is rude to everyone, not jus her, just as '
                 'Pickering is polite to everyone. He claims that it is not '
                 'important to have good or bad manners, but simply to behave '
                 'the same way toward everyone, regardless of class. Eliza is '
                 "still reluctant to go back to Higgins' house. She says that "
                 'she is a slave, despite her expensive clothes. Higgins '
                 'offers to adopt Eliza or marry her to Pickering, but Eliza '
                 'wants to marry Freddy Eynsford Hill, which irritates Higgins '
                 '(he wants her to marry someone of a higher class). Eliza is '
                 'still angry with Higgins and tells him that all she wants is '
                 "some kindness from him. She then says that if she can't have "
                 'kindness from him, she will have her independence. She tells '
                 'Higgins that she will become a teacher of phonetics, '
                 'stealing everything she has learned from him in order to '
                 "take his clients. Higgins is suddenly impressed by Eliza's "
                 'strength and confidence. Mrs. Higgins comes in to take Eliza '
                 'to the wedding. As she leaves, Higgins tells Eliza to buy '
                 'him some things, but Eliza tells him to do it himself. The '
                 'play ends with Higgins alone in the room, confident that '
                 'Eliza will do the errand as he asked.',

 'summary_text': "Let's get spooky, Shmoopers. It's 1706 and our narrator "
                 "Susanna English is in her old church. She's feeling pretty "
                 "haunted by the past and we're about to learn why: this lass "
                 'lived in Salem. Yep, the very Salem where the witch trials '
                 'went down in 1692 . The only reason Susanna is even back in '
                 'her old church is because Ann Putnam, an evil girl, is about '
                 'to apologize to the town. You see, Ann stirred up oodles of '
                 'trouble back in 1692, and Susanna wishes she could hop in a '
                 "time machine and change the past. And if there's one thing "
                 "Susanna really wants to change, it's her own part in the "
                 "witch trials. Wait, how was Susanna involved? Well we're "
                 'about to find out. Now that our narrator has given us a '
                 "not-so-cheery start to her tale, we're not surprised that "
                 'the rest of the story is pretty dark and creepy. She takes '
                 'us back to December of 1691. Susanna wants to hang out with '
                 "the girls who are chilling inside Reverend Parris's house "
                 "while he's out. And they're not being good little Puritans "
                 "either—nope, they're conjuring up spells with the reverend's "
                 'slave, Tituba. Now that is seriously against the rules. '
                 'Susanna never gets invited to join this group, but she does '
                 'have a chit chat with Tituba about her big bro William who '
                 'is out at sea, and over time Susanna learns that Tituba has '
                 'been meeting with Ann and her posse of girls. Oh, and these '
                 "girls are starting to act like they're possessed. Yep, you "
                 'read that right—possessed. By 1692, suspicions of witchcraft '
                 'have officially come to Salem. (By the way, the Salem Witch '
                 'Trials actually happened back in the day. So you know all '
                 'the folks who are accused of witchcraft in this book? Well '
                 "sadly that actually went down back in 1692. But here's the "
                 'strangest thing: no one knows why the witch craziness began. '
                 'So Ann Rinaldi came up with an idea about how the witch '
                 "mayhem might've started in Salem, and that's where the rest "
                 'of this story comes from. Now back to our regularly '
                 "scheduled programming.) So now we've got oodles of witch "
                 'nonsense afoot in Salem. The good news is that Susanna knows '
                 "better. She's not about to get mixed up in this witch craze "
                 "so she goes straight to Ann Putnam's house to tell her to "
                 "knock it off. But the bad news is that Ann won't listen. You "
                 'see, Ann says that with all their fake fits, she and her '
                 'posse are excused from chores and getting tons of attention, '
                 "to boot. They're having fun, and if it means naming some "
                 "folks as witches, Ann's happy to go for it. And when Susanna "
                 "threatens to let the cat out of the bag, Ann says she'll "
                 'name the English family as witches. Bully much? So one day '
                 'at the parsonage Ann and her clique accuse Tituba and two '
                 "other ladies of being witches. They're all carted off to "
                 "jail, which is super sad since, you know, since they're "
                 'innocent and all. Susanna is stuck keeping her big secret to '
                 'protect her family. All over Salem, there are two reactions '
                 'to all this witchcraft madness: Reaction (1): Yeowza '
                 '—arresting witches is fun. Even though most of the townsfolk '
                 "think being a witch means you've made a pact with the devil, "
                 'they sure do get excited about folks being accused of being '
                 "witches. Even Susanna's crush Johnathan thinks witches are "
                 'real. Reaction (2): Pshaw —believing in witchcraft is dumb. '
                 "Susanna's mom and dad, who are both cool freethinkers, know "
                 "that witchcraft is a bunch of malarkey and they're not "
                 'buying it. Her sister Mary, and their family friends Joseph '
                 'and Elizabeth Putnam are also too reasonable to hop on board '
                 'the witchcraft train. Unfortunately most of Salem seems to '
                 'favor mayhem, so the witch hunt continues. The lying girls '
                 'name more and more townsfolk and they start coming up for '
                 'trial. The only silver lining is that all this hullaballoo '
                 "makes Johnathan realize there aren't really witches in "
                 "Salem, so he's joins the good guys, which makes us happy. "
                 "But after Mama English defends an accused witch's sister one "
                 'day, she gets arrested for being a witch herself. Uh-oh . '
                 'Not long after, dad gets arrested too, so Susanna and Mary '
                 "head to Joseph and Elizabeth Putnam's house. Eventually "
                 "Susanna's mom, dad, and sis head off to Boston where they'll "
                 'have a bit more freedom than in the gross Salem jail. '
                 'Susanna hangs tight in Salem—she wants to be around in case '
                 'she gets a chance to out Ann for all her lying. And we '
                 'really want Susanna to speak up soon because the new '
                 'Governor Phips has set up a court to start trying the '
                 'witches for real. At the Court of Oyer and Terminer, oodles '
                 "of witches are found guilty… And now they've started hanging "
                 'people, too. Eventually Susanna tells Joseph what she knows. '
                 'Finally, right? Joseph wants Susanna to tell some of his '
                 'influential judge pals, but she ends up getting freaked out. '
                 "You see, there's word going around that a witch named Mary "
                 "Bradbury tried to wreck Susanna's big bro's ship and Susanna "
                 'spends a chunk of time believing this nonsense until a '
                 'meeting with Mary makes her come to her senses. So now we '
                 'can all breathe a big sigh of relief because Susanna tells '
                 'her story to a nice guy named Reverend Pike, and this '
                 'inspires him to write a letter to another Salem judge. Soon '
                 'after, Susanna chats with another important dude named '
                 'Thomas Brattle who publishes a letter speaking out against '
                 'the witch trials. The whole time folks are still being '
                 'hanged, which is pretty much the worst news ever. But '
                 'eventually all the reasonable chatter gets around and the '
                 'witch trials are over. Phew. Plus, big bro William returns '
                 "home. Susanna is stoked, but she's also super sad about the "
                 'nineteen innocent folks that were killed. And so are we. Now '
                 'fast forward back to 1706. Susanna is still in her old '
                 'church and Ann is apologizing to the whole congregation. '
                 "Here's the deal: Susanna is super peeved at Ann since she "
                 'caused some seriously murderous mayhem. But our girl '
                 "actually forgives Ann all the same, and that's pretty "
                 "impressive. Oh and there's more good news: Susanna and "
                 "Johnathan get hitched. Maybe this story isn't all spookiness "
                 'after all.',

 'summary_text': 'While on a Lenten vigil , Brother Francis encounters an old '
                 'wanderer in the desert. There is a minor misunderstanding '
                 'involving some cheese and a cudgel, but they straighten it '
                 'out, and the wanderer agrees to help Francis. Francis needs '
                 'to build a sound shelter, or else the monsters roaming this '
                 "post-apocalyptic wasteland might try to eat him while he's "
                 'sleeping. So the wanderer does Francis a solid by finding a '
                 "rock that'll make his shelter more secure. But when Francis "
                 'goes to retrieve the rock, he discovers a fallout shelter '
                 "from before the Age of Simplification. Snazzy. Now, don't "
                 "worry if you don't quite understand everything what we're "
                 "talking about here, Shmoopers—that's precisely Miller's "
                 'style. He wants to set you down right in the middle of the '
                 'action , and have you strap on your Discoverer Hats along '
                 'with Brother Francis. Like, what do you think was '
                 '"simplified" in the Age of Simplification? Okay, so, imagine '
                 "you're right there with Brother Francis in this fallout "
                 "shelter, which is essentially a time capsule. And you're "
                 'sifting through trinkets and mementos from the long-vanished '
                 'era. Then, hark: Brother Francis discovers a treasure trove '
                 'of Memorabilia with the name Leibowitz on it. This is all '
                 'very curious, because this Leibowitz character is currently '
                 "up for sainthood in Brother Francis's very own abbey—he was "
                 'the founding member, you know. So discovering any more '
                 "information about the guy's past, and what he did before the "
                 "Age of Simplification, is both dangerous and thrilling; it's "
                 'like finding out your parents actually had lives before you '
                 'were born. (Whoa.) Francis presents the news to his abbot, '
                 "but Abbot Arkos is less than impressed. Sounds like he's "
                 'choosing "fear of danger" over "thrill of discovery" here. '
                 "Arkos thinks that sharing Francis's story with others will "
                 "only make Leibowitz's bid for sainthood more difficult. "
                 'Instead, Arkos suppresses the story by locking up the '
                 'fallout shelter and keeping Francis a novice for upward of '
                 'seven years. Which is basically like being a freshman for '
                 "seven years straight despite passing grades. It's a very "
                 "personal hell that we'd never wish upon you, dear readers. "
                 'Eventually, New Rome does reopen the investigation, however. '
                 'And Francis is given a job as a copyist, where he begins '
                 "working on an illuminated copy of Leibowitz's electronic "
                 'blueprint. Finally, some new light can be shed on this '
                 'long-buried—er, locked—mystery. Years later, Leibowitz is '
                 'finally beatified. Brother Francis is invited to the '
                 'ceremony, and en route to New Rome to attend, he is robbed '
                 'by a highwayman. The dude takes his illuminated manuscript. '
                 'Eek. At New Rome, Brother Francis is thanked for his '
                 'contribution to the Memorabilia church and given the money '
                 'to buy back his precious illuminated copy. Upon returning to '
                 'the site of the robbery though, Francis is killed by two '
                 'mutants who decide Francis foie gras will make a tasty '
                 'afternoon treat. This post-Simpflication world is pretty '
                 "nasty. But just as everything's about to fade to black, as "
                 'they say, the old wanderer discovers the body being feasted '
                 'on by the buzzards. He cares for it and gives it a proper '
                 'burial. Hm. Kind of makes you wonder who this "old wanderer" '
                 'is after all, huh? 600 years later, Thon Taddeo, a famous '
                 "scholar, hears word of the abbey's Memorabilia. Like most "
                 'famous scholars, he wants to figure out if he can criticize '
                 'the Memorabilia. Just kidding. Kind of. What he really wants '
                 'is to study its authenticity—is any of the stuff real '
                 "anyway? Dom Paulo, the new abbot, accepts Taddeo's request "
                 'to visit. But he worries about what Taddeo will discover, or '
                 'have to say about his discoveries, since Taddeo is not a man '
                 "of God. He's just a regular old secular scholar. Before "
                 'Taddeo comes to call, Dom Paulo visits his old friend '
                 'Benjamin. He wants to return a goat the hermit lost to the '
                 'Poet in a game of chance. Benjamin and Paulo discuss Taddeo, '
                 "and wonder whether he'll be able to change the world for the "
                 'better. Or, will Taddeo simply continue a cycle of death and '
                 'destruction? Sounds like a pretty big logical leap, we '
                 'realize. But not for Benjamin. He claims to be immortal, or '
                 "near enough, and so he's seen this same cycle time and time "
                 "again. So he's thinking on a much bigger time scale than us "
                 'puny human types. When Taddeo arrives and studies the '
                 "Memorabilia, he's totally amazed by the wealth of knowledge "
                 "it contains. He's even more impressed by Brother Kornhoer, "
                 'whose arc lamp has returned electric light to the world. But '
                 'not everything is peaches-and-creamy awesome. Taddeo has '
                 "little patience for religion, and it's soon learned that "
                 'Hannegan, the mayor-royal of Texarkana, has declared the '
                 'Pope a heretic. Hannegan clearly wants more power than the '
                 "church, and so he's out to take it away from the Pope. After "
                 "brawlin' a bit with the monks of the abbey over the validity "
                 'of religious knowledge versus scientific knowledge, Taddeo '
                 'leaves. Dom Paulo offers to let Taddeo, or any scholar who '
                 'wishes to return to the abbey, stay. Paulo believes '
                 'communication between religion and science is necessary to '
                 'keep the peace and prevent people like Hannegan from '
                 'assuming too much power. But not long afterward, Dom Paulo '
                 'dies. And his vision of power-based war comes to life: '
                 'conflict breaks out across the land. Another 600 years '
                 'passes—shazam. And now that the world has rediscovered its '
                 'lost technology, nuclear weapons maintain a tenuous peace. '
                 'Very tenuous. Yikes. Abbot Zerchi and New Rome prepare a '
                 'mission to the colonies so that the Catholic Church and '
                 'Memorabilia might survive the all-but-inevitable destruction '
                 'of Earth. Zerchi tasks Brother Joshua with leading the '
                 'mission. Joshua is hesitant, at first, but eventually agrees '
                 '(probably because slim odds are better than no odds , are we '
                 'right?). Then a nuclear weapon strikes near the Leibowitz '
                 'Abbey. Zerchi opens his doors to aid those in need and '
                 'grants Doctor Cors permission to run a Green Star relief '
                 'camp within the abbey—but only with the understanding that '
                 'euthanasia may not be administered or even suggested. '
                 'Remember that whole bit of religious doctrine where suicide '
                 'is a sin? And so is murder? Yeah, that stuff is pretty '
                 'relevant here. Anyway, Doctor Cors agrees to the terms, but '
                 'shortly thereafter encounters a hopeless mother and child. '
                 'So the doctor breaks his promise and sets up a '
                 'euthanasia-administration-stand down the road. Father Zerchi '
                 'tries to talk the mother and daughter out of assisted '
                 'suicide, but is unsuccessful. Heartbroken and discouraged, '
                 'Zerchi hears the confession of a mutant named Mrs. Grales, a '
                 'two-headed woman who wishes to have her "sister," Rachel, '
                 'baptized. During the confession, a nuclear explosion '
                 'destroys the abbey. Zerchi manages to survive but is trapped '
                 'beneath the rubble. As he awaits his ultimate fate, Mrs. '
                 'Grales comes to him; only it is the head of Rachel that '
                 'lives while Mrs. Grales slumps dead on their shoulders. '
                 'Seemingly free of sin and pain, and possessing miraculous '
                 'powers, Rachel gives Zerchi the sacrament of communion '
                 "before he dies. Elsewhere, the church's mission to the space "
                 'colonies launches, leaving a devastated Earth behind for an '
                 'unknown future. Dun, dun, dun. Unknown future, ahoy.',

{'author': 'Arthur C. Clarke',
 'book_title': '2001: A Space Odyssey',
 'source': 'shmoop',
 'summary_text': '2001 covers millions of years of plot, from prehistoric '
                 'times and on into cosmic timeless space future (or what was '
                 'the future in 1968, when the book was written). Yet, despite '
                 "that, the plot actually isn't all that complicated. A big "
                 "part of that is because there's no real character "
                 'development to speak of. Another part is that a lot of the '
                 'book is just description of astronomical niftiness. The '
                 'result is that 2001 manages to cover a lot of ground without '
                 'much plot. A lot of whoosh, not a whole lot of bang. The '
                 'novel starts millions of years in the past, with a bunch of '
                 'man-apes. Being a man-ape kind of sucks; you only eat '
                 "berries, you're always hungry, you die young. But then a "
                 'space slab falls to earth and starts tinkering with the '
                 "man-apes' minds. Moon-Watcher, our hero man-ape, gets "
                 'especially smart, and figures out how to use tools. He kills '
                 'a pig for food, then a leopard, then the head of a rival '
                 'tribe. Man-apes are moving on up. Millions of years pass, '
                 'till 2001 or thereabouts (a year that was thirty years in '
                 'the future when Clarke wrote the novel). Dr. Heywood Floyd '
                 '(who has less personality than the space slab) goes to the '
                 'moon to look at a big slab the moon colonists have excavated '
                 "called TMA-1. Just as he gets there, the sun's rays hit the "
                 'slab, and it starts broadcasting a signal. (Good timing, Dr. '
                 'Floyd.) Cut to a few months down the space road. David '
                 'Bowman and Frank Poole are in the ship Discovery , '
                 'originally headed for Jupiter, but now diverted to Saturn at '
                 "the last minute. They're going to the Saturn moon Japaetus, "
                 'which is where the TMA-1 broadcast signal was directed. '
                 "Bowman and Poole don't know about the aliens for reasons "
                 "that don't make a lot of sense (other people on Earth "
                 "definitely know), but then again, we've also got giant slabs "
                 "on the moon, so what's a plothole or two between friends? "
                 "Anyway, Bowman and Poole weren't told about the aliens; only "
                 'their computer Hal was told (and three crewmembers in '
                 'suspended animation). This was supposed to be for security '
                 'reasons, but unfortunately Hal is a truthful computer, and '
                 'keeping a secret drives him loony-moons. Poor Hal…but on the '
                 'other hand this creates the only real actual plot kind of '
                 'thing in the book, as Hal murders Poole and tries to kill '
                 'Bowman. He also kills the folks in suspended animation '
                 "before Bowman takes him down. Then it's back to descriptions "
                 'of starscapes and not much happening. Bye Hal. We miss you. '
                 'Bowman gets to Japaetus, and finds an even bigger slab on '
                 'the moon. He figure he might as well check it out since the '
                 "mission has gotten all messed up and he's going to die "
                 'anyway before another ship can come out and rescue him. So '
                 'he space-pods down to the giant slab, which is actually a '
                 'Star Gate. It sucks him in and spits him out on the other '
                 'end of the galaxy. (Insert sucking and spitting noises here. '
                 'Cover your mouth, Star Gate.) Bowman sees lots of cool '
                 'astronomical stuff before his pod lands in a hotel room the '
                 'aliens set up to make him feel comfortable. Then the aliens '
                 'turn Bowman into a super space baby, and he zips back to '
                 'earth. Bet that was not what you thought was coming. Back on '
                 'earth, he is either attacked by nuclear weapons or else gets '
                 "back just in time to stop a nuclear war, it's not exactly "
                 'clear which. Either way, he zaps the nuclear weapons with '
                 'his space baby powers and then floats out there in space '
                 'baby contemplation, trying to figure out what to do with the '
                 'earth. So basically the whole novel is a lengthy origin '
                 'story to explain the coming of super space baby.',
