# Notes & Concerns
- Some online sources are not well-structures.
    - Messy HTML structure - confusing class name, using different HTML tags on similar content, trailing white spaces and unnecessary punctuations, etc.
    - Titles / subtitles are mixed with paragraphs (we can only differentiate them after understanding their meanings)
    - Using plain text for displaying structured data (e.g., the third paragraph on [this page](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/streetcar-named-desire/stanley-kowalski))

- Human-understandable content incorrectness
    - typos
    - unrelated content
    - bad / incorrect titling and sectioning

- Hard to differentiate character description and analysis (e.g., [Shmoop](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature) does not specify whether the paragraphs on character page are description or analysis)

- No clear definition of the quality of data
